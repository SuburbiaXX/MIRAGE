Among the millions of discovered patterns, we found a subset of 127,998 \npatterns, termed pyknons, which have additional nonoverlapping instances in the \nuntranslated and protein-coding regions of 30,675 transcripts from 20,059 human \ngenes. The pyknons arrange combinatorially in the untranslated and coding \nregions of numerous human genes where they form mosaics. Consecutive instances \nof pyknons in these regions show a strong bias in their relative placement, \nfavoring distances of approximately 22 nucleotides. We also found pyknons to be \nenriched in a statistically significant manner in genes involved in specific \nprocesses, e.g., cell communication, transcription, regulation of transcription, \nsignaling, transport, etc. For approximately 1/3 of the pyknons, the \nintergenic/intronic instances of their reverse complement lie within 380,084 \nnonoverlapping regions, typically 60-80 nucleotides long, which are predicted to \nform double-stranded, energetically stable, hairpin-shaped RNA secondary \nstructures; additionally, the pyknons subsume approximately 40% of the known \nmicroRNA sequences, thus suggesting a possible link with posttranscriptional \ngene silencing and RNA interference. Cross-genome comparisons reveal that many \nof the pyknons have instances in the 3' UTRs of genes from other vertebrates and \ninvertebrates where they are overrepresented in similar biological processes, as \nin the human genome. These unexpected findings suggest potential unique \nfunctional connections between the coding and noncoding parts of the human \ngenome."

Activation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 \n(ACE2) has shown to attenuate devastating effects of Ang II in the \ncardiovascular system by reducing Ang II degradation and increasing Ang-(1-7) \ngeneration leading to Mas receptor activation. Recent Advances: Activation of \nthe ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis reduces hypertension and improves vascular \ninjury mainly through an increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and \ndecreased reactive oxygen species production. Recent studies reported that \nshedding of the enzymatically active ectodomain of ACE2 from the cell surface \nseems to regulate its activity and serves as an interorgan communicator in \ncardiovascular disease. In addition, collectrin, an ACE2 homolog with no \ncatalytic activity, regulates blood pressure through an NO-dependent mechanism.\nCRITICAL ISSUES: Large body of experimental data confirmed sustained beneficial \neffects of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis activation on hypertension and \nvascular injury.

One challenge presented by large \ngenome-wide datasets is the ability to differentiate between patterns that are \nremnants of natural selection from those expected to arise at random and/or as a \nconsequence of selectively neutral demographic forces acting in the population.\nFINDINGS: SmileFinder is a simple program that looks for diversity and \ndivergence patterns consistent with selection sweeps by evaluating allele \nfrequencies in windows, including neighboring loci from two or more populations \nof a diploid species against the genome-wide neutral expectation. The program \ncalculates the mean of heterozygosity and FST in a set of sliding windows of \nincrementally increasing sizes, and then builds a resampled distribution (the \nbaseline) of random multi-locus sets matched to the sizes of sliding windows, \nusing an unrestricted sampling.

Activated matriptase was also detected at \nmuch higher levels in both the basal and spinous layer keratinocytes in sun \ndamaged skin with actinic elastosis. UVB and solar light-induced matriptase \nzymogen activation likely results from UV-induced ROS generation, given that \nUVR, UVA, and UVB irradiation induced HaCaT human keratinocytes to activate \nmatriptase in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and that this was suppressed by \nthe ROS scavenger N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone and reducing agent \ndithiothreitol. Matriptase deficient HaCaT keratinocytes were more susceptible \nto UV-induced apoptosis than control cells, suggesting a protective role for \nmatriptase in UV exposed keratinocytes.\nCONCLUSION: UV irradiation/ROS induced matriptase proteolysis may have short \nterm protective effects and contribute to the recovery from acute epidermal \ndamage and/or pathology of skin with chronic sun damage."

    "corpus": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the possible protective \neffect of interleukin 18-binding protein (IL-18BP) on ischemia-reperfusion \n(I/R)-induced liver injury in experimental rat models. Liver is one of the most \naffected organs from I/R process. IL-18 is an important proinflammatory \ncytokine, which may induce some events such as production of reactive oxygen \nsubstances and release of various cytokines. IL-18BP acts as an inhibitor of \nIL-18. The relationship between IL-18 and IL-18BP has an important place in \ninflammatory process.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were equally divided into three groups as follows: \nsham: Hepatic pedicle dissection was done, but hepatic pedicle clamping was not \nused. I/R: Sixty minutes of ischemia and 2 h of reperfusion were applied. IR + \nIL-18BP: Recombinant human IL-18BP (100 μg/kg) was administered 30 min before \nthe surgery. Hepatic pedicle was clamped during 60 min of ischemia and 2 h of \nreperfusion was achieved.\nRESULTS: Liver enzyme levels were significantly lower in the IR + IL-18BP group, \nwhen compared with the I/R group. Serum and tissue levels of tumor necrosis \nfactor-α, IL-6, and IL-18 were considerably lower in the IR + IL-18BP group, \nwhen compared with the I/R group, but hepatic interferon-γ and IL1β levels were \nnot significant. Serum oxidative stress index level was significantly higher in \nthe I/R group, when compared with the IR + IL-18BP group. In immunostaining, it \nwas observed that pathologic changes were lower in IR + IL-18BP group than the \nI/R group.\nCONCLUSIONS: IL-18BP exhibited anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and protective \neffects in I/R-mediated hepatic injury via regulating some liver enzyme \nactivities and cytokine levels. Additionally, these effects have been verified \nby histomorphologic examination and oxidative stress markers."

It has two sub-pathways, the global genome (gg) NER and the transcription-coupled repair (TCR). TCR is triggered when a RNA polymerase, translocating along the transcribed strand, is arrested at a lesion or unusual structure in the DNA.

    "corpus_id": "11452033",
    "corpus": "It has been previously shown that disruption of RAD26 in yeast strain W303-1B \nresults in a strain that is deficient in transcription-coupled repair (TCR), the \npreferential repair of the transcribed strand of an expressed gene over the \nnon-transcribed strand and the rest of the genome. RAD26 encodes a protein that \nis homologous to Cockayne syndrome group B protein (CSB) and is a member of the \nSWI2/SNF2 family of DNA-dependent ATPases involved in chromatin remodeling. Like \nthe rad26 mutant, cells from Cockayne syndrome patients are defective in TCR. We \nexamined the role of Rad26 in TCR by disrupting RAD26 in two repair-proficient \nlaboratory strains and, remarkably, observed no effect upon TCR. Our results \nindicate that disruption of RAD26 alone is insufficient to impair TCR. Thus, \nW303-1B must already possess a mutation that, together with disruption of RAD26, \ncauses a deficiency in TCR. We suggest that other genes are mutated in Cockayne \nsyndrome cells that contribute to the deficiency in TCR. Surprisingly, deletion \nof RAD26 results in expression of genes that are repressed by flanking \ntransposon delta elements, an Spt(-) phenotype. The delta elements appear to \nperturb local chromatin structure. Expression of genes flanked by delta elements \nin rad26Delta mutants is consistent with a role for Rad26 in chromatin \nremodeling."

However, this technique is unsuitable for multiple-tracer \nimaging because the annihilation photons used for PET imaging have a fixed \nenergy regardless of the selection of the radionuclide tracer. This study \ndeveloped a multi-isotope PET (MI-PET) system and evaluated its imaging \nperformance.\nMETHODS: Our MI-PET system is composed of a PET system and additional γ-ray \ndetectors. The PET system consists of pixelized gadolinium orthosilicate (GSO) \nscintillation detectors and has a ring geometry that is 95 mm in diameter with \nan axial field of view of 37.5 mm. The additional detectors are eight bismuth \ngermanium oxide (BGO) scintillation detectors, each of which is 50 × 50 × 30 mm3 \n, arranged into two rings mounted on each side of the PET ring with a \n92-mm-inner diameter. This system can distinguish between different tracers \nusing the additional γ-ray detectors to observe prompt γ-rays, which are emitted \nafter positron emission and have an energy intrinsic to each radionuclide. Our \nsystem can simultaneously acquire double- (two annihilation photons) and triple- \n(two annihilation photons and a prompt γ-ray) coincidence events. The system's \nefficiency for detecting prompt de-excitation γ-rays was measured using a \npositron-γ emitter, 22 Na. Dual-radionuclide (18 F and 22 Na) imaging of a rod \nphantom and a mouse was performed to demonstrate the performance of the \ndeveloped system. Our system's basic performance was evaluated by reconstructing \ntwo images, one containing both tracers and the other containing just the second \ntracer, from list-mode data sets that were categorized by the presence or \nabsence of the prompt γ-ray.\nRESULTS: The maximum detection efficiency for 1275 keV γ-rays emitted from 22 Na \nwas approximately 7% at the scanner's center, and the minimum detection \nefficiency was 5.1% at the edge of the field of view. Dual-radionuclide imaging \nof the point sources and rod phantom revealed that our system maintained PET's \nintrinsic spatial resolution and quantitative nature for the second tracer. We \nalso successfully acquired simultaneous double- and triple-coincidence events \nfrom a mouse containing 18 F-fluoro-deoxyglucose and 22 Na dissolved in water. \nThe dual-tracer distributions in the mouse obtained by our MI-PET were \nreasonable from the viewpoints of physiology and pharmacokinetics.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of multiple-tracer imaging \nusing PET with additional γ-ray detectors.

    "correct_answer": "TIA-1 is an RNA binding protein that promotes the assembly of stress granules (SGs), discrete cytoplasmic inclusions into which stalled translation initiation complexes are dynamically recruited in cells subjected to environmental stress. The RNA recognition motifs of TIA-1 are linked to a glutamine-rich prion-related domain (PRD). Truncation mutants lacking the PRD domain do not induce spontaneous SGs and are not recruited to arsenite-induced SGs, whereas the PRD forms aggregates that are recruited to SGs in low-level-expressing cells but prevent SG assembly in high-level-expressing cells.",

    "corpus": "Stress granules aid cell survival in response to environmental stressors by \nacting as sites of translational repression. We report an unanticipated link \nbetween stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast \ncells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding \nprotein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The \nRSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the \nprion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in \nresponse to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits \nits nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal \ndomain. Nuclear accumulation is dependent on TIA-1. Surprisingly, nuclear \nlocalization of RSK2 is sufficient to enhance proliferation through induction of \ncyclin D1, in the absence of other active signaling pathways. Hence, RSK2 is a \npivotal factor linking the stress response to survival and proliferation."

On the basis of its \nantimyeloid and DNA-damaging properties, we investigated the ability of MLN4924 \nto augment conventional cytarabine (ara-C) therapy.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effects of MLN4924/ara-C on viability, clonogenic \nsurvival, apoptosis, DNA damage, and relevant pharmacodynamic targets were \ndetermined. The efficacy and pharmacodynamics of MLN4924/ara-C were assessed in \nan AML xenograft model.\nRESULTS: Cotreatment of AML cell lines and primary patient specimens with \nMLN4924 and ara-C led to diminished clonogenic survival, increased apoptosis, \nand synergistic levels of DNA damage. RNAi demonstrated that stabilization of \nCDT-1, an event previously shown to mediate the DNA-damaging effects of MLN4924, \nwas not a key regulator of sensitivity to the MLN4924/ara-C combination. Global \nmetabolic profiling revealed that MLN4924 disrupts nucleotide metabolism and \ndepletes intracellular nucleotide pools in AML cells.

Due \nto various analytical challenges, so far no proteome has been sequenced \ncompletely. O'Shea, Weissman and co-workers have recently determined the copy \nnumber of yeast proteins, making this proteome an excellent model system to \nstudy factors affecting coverage.\nRESULTS: To probe the yeast proteome in depth and determine factors currently \npreventing complete analysis, we grew yeast cells, extracted proteins and \nseparated them by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Peptides resulting from \ntrypsin digestion were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry on a \nlinear ion trap-Fourier transform mass spectrometer with very high mass accuracy \nand sequencing speed. We achieved unambiguous identification of more than 2,000 \nproteins, including very low abundant ones. Effective dynamic range was limited \nto about 1,000 and effective sensitivity to about 500 femtomoles, far from the \nsubfemtomole sensitivity possible with single proteins.

Although major bleeding did not occur unless \nAPTT was prolonged excessively, minor bleeding arose irrespective of the APTT \nvalues even within the range of the APTT values not exceeding 80s."

We \ncharacterized oral anticoagulant prescribing patterns and identified predictors \nof receiving anticoagulants within 30 days of the index ED visit.

This \nproliferative effect of TGF-beta was found to be concentration- dependent, but \nisoform-independent. Furthermore, even a transient exposure of the cells to this \ngrowth factor was sufficient to exert its stimulatory or inhibitory action. \nAccordingly, we have studied the immediate responses provoked by TGF-beta in \nmajor signaling pathways, and we have found that it induces a rapid activation \nof the SMAD pathway, i.e., phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD2, \nfollowed by dephosphorylation, most probably due to degradation by the \nproteasome.

Various \nmolecules, such as derivatives of fluoroquinolones (e.g. gatifloxacin, \nmoxifloxacin and DC-159a), rifamycins (rifapentine), oxazolidinones (linezolid, \nsutezolid/PNU-100480), diarylquinolines (TMC207/bedaquiline), antifungal azoles, \npyrrole (LL3858), nitroimidazopyran (PA824), nitroimidazole (OPC67683, TBA-354), \ndiamine (SQ109) and benzothiazinone (BTZ043) are being developed in an attempt \nto combat the disease. This review presents a general introduction to the \ncurrent status of the disease, the biology of the pathogen as well as the state \nof drug development against tuberculosis (TB) with emphasis on the major \nproblems and bottlenecks associated with the same. Starting from the first drug \nagainst TB, the review discusses the entire history and the course of \ndevelopment of the drugs which are available today in the market as well as \nthose which are under various phases of clinical and pre-clinical trials along \nwith their mechanism of action. It also talks about the possible role of \nnanosciences in combating TB."

    "corpus_id": "12446625",
    "corpus": "Obligately aerobic tubercle bacilli are capable of adapting to survive hypoxia \nby developing into a nonreplicating or dormant form. Dormant bacilli maintain \nviability for extended periods. Furthermore, they are resistant to \nantimycobacterials, and hence, dormancy might play a role in the persistence of \ntuberculosis infection despite prolonged chemotherapy. Previously, we have grown \ndormant Mycobacterium bovis BCG in an oxygen-limited Wayne culture system and \nsubjected the bacilli to proteome analysis. This work revealed the upregulation \nof the response regulator Rv3133c and three other polypeptides (alpha-crystallin \nand two \"conserved hypothetical\" proteins) upon entry into dormancy. Here, we \nreplaced the coding sequence of the response regulator with a kanamycin \nresistance cassette and demonstrated that the loss-of-function mutant died after \noxygen starvation-induced termination of growth. Thus, the disruption of this \ndormancy-induced transcription factor resulted in loss of the ability of BCG to \nadapt to survival of hypoxia. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of protein \nextracts from the gene-disrupted strain showed that the genetic loss of the \nresponse regulator caused loss of the induction of the other three dormancy \nproteins. Thus, the upregulation of these dormancy proteins requires the \nresponse regulator. Based on these two functions, dormancy survival and \nregulation, we named the Rv3133c gene dosR for dormancy survival regulator. Our \nresults provide conclusive evidence that DosR is a key regulator in the oxygen \nstarvation-induced mycobacterial dormancy response."

Microdeletions at 5q35.3, \nencompassing NSD1, are responsible for approximately 10% of non-Japanese cases \nof Sotos. In contrast, a recurrent approximately 2 Mb microdeletion has been \nreported as responsible for approximately 50% of Japanese cases of Sotos.\nMETHODS: We screened 471 cases for NSD1 mutations and deletions and identified \n23 with 5q35 microdeletions. We investigated the deletion size, parent of \norigin, and mechanism of generation in these and a further 10 cases identified \nfrom published reports. We used \"in silico\" analyses to investigate whether \nrepetitive elements that could generate microdeletions flank NSD1.\nRESULTS: Three repetitive elements flanking NSD1, designated REPcen, REPmid, and \nREPtel, were identified. Up to 18 cases may have the same sized deletion, but at \nleast eight unique deletion sizes were identified, ranging from 0.4 to 5 Mb. In \nmost instances, the microdeletion arose through interchromosomal rearrangements \nof the paternally inherited chromosome.\nCONCLUSIONS: Frequency, size, and mechanism of generation of 5q35 microdeletions \ndiffer between Japanese and non-Japanese cases of Sotos. Our microdeletions were \nidentified from a large case series with a broad range of phenotypes, suggesting \nthat sample selection variability is unlikely as a sole explanation for these \ndifferences and that variation in genomic architecture might be a contributory \nfactor. Non-allelic homologous recombination between REPcen and REPtel may have \ngenerated up to 18 microdeletion cases in our series.

Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are childhood \ndiseases that can be life threatening; poliomyelitis, another childhood disease, \ncan be disabling. In turn, vaccinations were developed to provide protection \nagainst these diseases. Today, several vaccinations are recommended for \nchildren, including but not limited to diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) \nand poliomyelitis (IPV). DTaP requires five doses, and IPV requires four. \nQuadracel (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis adsorbed and \ninactivated poliovirus vaccine, Sanofi Pasteur Inc.) is a new vaccination \ndeveloped to condense the last dose of both DTaP and IPV so they do not have to \nbe given separately, thus reducing the total number of vaccinations required.\nDISCUSSION: The Quadracel vaccine is an option for use in children who are \ncompleting the DTaP and IPV series. In a randomized, controlled, phase 3, \npivotal trial, Quadracel proved to be as efficacious and safe as Daptacel \n(diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine adsorbed, Sanofi \nPasteur Inc.) and IPOL (poliovirus vaccine inactivated, Sanofi Pasteur Inc.), \ngiven separately, to children between the ages of 4 and 6 years.\nCONCLUSION: Quadracel should be recommended to parents who have children between \nthe ages of 4 and 6 years who meet the necessary administration criteria and \nneed to finalize their DTaP and IPV series. Quadracel's administration in the \nvaccination series replaces one additional injection, which may benefit children \nwho are afraid of receiving shots and parents who need to schedule one less \ndoctor's appointment."

Thyroid ultrasonography was performed \nin 37 patients. Thyroid antibodies (thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin) were \nmeasured in all patients with abnormal thyroid function tests.\nRESULTS: None of our patients had overt hypothyroidism; 29 patients (31.5%) had \nsubclinical hypothyroidism. Thyroid antibodies were absent in all patients. The \nprevalence of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism was significantly higher \nin the younger patients. Ultrasonography revealed morphological or volumetric \nabnormalities of the thyroid gland in 67.5% of patients; these abnormalities \nwere more frequently observed in the older children.\nCONCLUSIONS: Subclinical hypothyroidism is a frequent but stable finding in \nyoung children with WS. The great majority of patients with WS >10 years, either \nwith normal or hypoplastic thyroid, have normal thyroid function. Therefore, we \nsuggest yearly monitoring of thyroid function and sonographic studies at least \nonce in patients with WS. Treatment should be reserved for the patients with \novert hypothyroidism or for those whose thyroid function shows signs of \nprogressive deterioration."

    "corpus": "PURPOSE: CYLD is a tumor suppressor that has been linked to the development of \nvarious human malignancies, including colon cancer. The tumor-suppressing \nfunction of CYLD is associated with its deubiquitinating activity, which maps to \nthe carboxyl-terminal region of the protein. In the present study we evaluated \nthe role of intestinal epithelial CYLD in colitis-associated cancer using a \nconditional mouse CYLD inactivation model.\nMETHODS: In order to evaluate the role of CYLD in intestinal epithelial \ncarcinogenesis, mice (IEC-Cyld (Δ9) mice) that carry a mutation that eliminates \nthe deubiquitinating domain of CYLD in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) were \ngenerated by crossing Villin-Cre transgenic mice to previously generated mice \ncarrying a loxP-flanked Cyld exon 9 (Cyld (flx9) mice).\nRESULTS: We found that IEC-Cyld (Δ9) mice did not present spontaneous intestinal \nabnormalities up to one year of age. However, upon challenge with a combination \nof genotoxic (AOM) and pro-inflammatory (DSS) agents we found that the number of \nadenomas in the IEC-Cyld (Δ9) mice was dramatically increased compared to the \ncontrol mice. Inactivation of CYLD in intestinal epithelial cells did not affect \nthe classical nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and c-Jun kinase (JNK) activation \npathways under physiological conditions, suggesting that these pathways do not \npredispose CYLD-deficient intestinal epithelia to colorectal cancer development \nbefore the onset of genotoxic and/or pro-inflammatory stress.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore a critical tumor-suppressing role for \nfunctional intestinal epithelial CYLD in colitis-associated carcinogenesis.

Alternative \ntherapies for excoriation disorder and other body-focused repetitive behaviors \ninclude yoga, aerobic exercise, acupuncture, biofeedback, hypnosis, and inositol \nand N-acetylcysteine, among others. Objective • This review article intended to \nreview the current literature on the alternative therapies to provide a brief \nupdate on their benefits for the treatment of excoriation disorder for use in \nconjunction with psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in the management of a \nchallenging group of patients. Design • This review (focusing on literature \npublished in the last 15 y, selected from a search of PubMed) critically \nconsiders the evidence for the use of alternative therapies in the treatment of \nexcoriation disorder. Setting • This review was conducted at the National \nUniversity of Asunción (San Lorenzo, Paraguay). Results • Results for yoga were \nas follows: This technique may influence the structure and functioning of the \nareas of emotional processing involved in the pathophysiology of excoriation \ndisorder and other body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as trichotillomania. \nAlthough still limited, the current research team's use of yoga as a treatment \nhas given useful results.

As exercise has qualities that allow individuals to improve their mood \nand reduce their anxiety, it is likely that it also can help reduce behaviors \nlike hair pulling or scratching, and it should be considered to be an adjunctive \ntherapy. Results for acupuncture were as follows: The mechanism of action of \nacupuncture increases serotonergic activity and releases endorphins in the \nhypothalamus and limbic region, which could be beneficial in patients with \ntrichotillomania and excoriation disorder. Results for biofeedback were as \nfollows: Several case reports have suggested the value of biofeedback in \nreducing tics, which bear some psychophysiological similarities to body-focused \nrepetitive behaviors, such as trichotillomania and excoriation disorder. Results \nfor hypnosis were as follows: When used as a channel for other types of \ninterventions, such as psychotherapy, hypnosis can help counteract the stress \nthat triggers the picking behaviors in some patients.

    "corpus": "The fates of RNA species in a cell are controlled by ribonucleases, which \ndegrade them by exploiting the universal structural 2'-OH group. This phenomenon \nplays a key role in numerous transformative technologies, for example, RNA \ninterference and CRISPR/Cas13-based RNA editing systems. These approaches, \nhowever, are genetic or oligomer-based and so have inherent limitations. This \nhas led to interest in the development of small molecules capable of degrading \nnucleic acids in a targeted manner. Here we describe click-degraders, small \nmolecules that can be covalently attached to RNA species through click-chemistry \nand can degrade them, that are akin to ribonucleases. By using these molecules, \nwe have developed the meCLICK-Seq (methylation CLICK-degradation Sequencing) a \nmethod to identify RNA modification substrates with high resolution at intronic \nand intergenic regions. The method hijacks RNA methyltransferase activity to \nintroduce an alkyne, instead of a methyl, moiety on RNA. Subsequent \ncopper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction with the click-degrader \nleads to RNA cleavage and degradation exploiting a mechanism used by endogenous \nribonucleases. Focusing on N6-methyladenosine (m6A), meCLICK-Seq identifies \nmethylated transcripts, determines RNA methylase specificity, and reliably maps \nmodification sites in intronic and intergenic regions. Importantly, we show that \nMETTL16 deposits m6A to intronic polyadenylation (IPA) sites, which suggests a \npotential role for METTL16 in IPA and, in turn, splicing. Unlike other methods, \nthe readout of meCLICK-Seq is depletion, not enrichment, of modified RNA \nspecies, which allows a comprehensive and dynamic study of RNA modifications \nthroughout the transcriptome, including regions of low abundance. The \nclick-degraders are highly modular and so may be exploited to study any RNA \nmodification and design new technologies that rely on RNA degradation."

High expression of Snord116 was evident in the paraventricular (PVN) and ventromedial (VMH) nuclei, but particularly prevalent in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) according to in situ hybridization. Snord116 expression level in ventral hypothalamic dissections including ARC was significantly greater (by 2-fold) than that in cortex; and its expression level in dorsal hypothalamic dissections including PVN was double that in cortex. The enhanced expression pattern of Snord116 in hypothalamic nuclei was observed at weaning and young adult stages, but less obvious neonatally when expression was significantly more widespread. Therefore the expression of Snord116 likely is regulated developmentally.\nSnord116del mice with paternally derived deletion lack expression of this snoRNA. They have early-onset postnatal growth deficiency, but normal fertility and lifespan. While pituitary structure and somatotrophs are normal, liver Igf1 mRNA is decreased. In cognitive and behavior tests, Snord116del mice are deficient in motor learning and have increased anxiety. Around three months of age, they develop hyperphagia, but stay lean on regular and high-fat diet. On reduced caloric intake, Snord116del mice maintain their weight better than wild-type littermates, excluding increased energy requirement as a cause of hyperphagia. Normal compensatory feeding after fasting, and ability to maintain body temperature in the cold indicate normal energy homeostasis regulation. Metabolic chamber studies reveal that Snord116del mice maintain energy homeostasis by altered fuel usage. Prolonged mealtime and increased circulating ghrelin indicate a defect in meal termination mechanism.

Patients with the infantile form of \nKrabbe disease can be treated at a presymptomatic stage with human stem cell \ntransplantation which improves survival and clinical outcomes. However, without \na family history, most cases of infantile Krabbe disease present after onset of \nsymptoms and are ineligible for transplantation. In 2006, New York began \nscreening newborns for Krabbe disease to identify presymptomatic cases. To \nensure that those identified with infantile disease received timely treatment, \nNew York public health and medical systems took steps to accurately diagnose and \nrapidly refer infants for human stem cell transplantation within the first few \nweeks of life. After 11 years of active screening in New York and the \nintroduction of Krabbe disease newborn screening in other states, new \ninformation has been gained which can inform the design of newborn screening \nprograms to improve infantile Krabbe disease outcomes.\nFINDINGS: Recent information relevant to Krabbe disease screening, diagnosis, \nand treatment were assessed by a diverse group of public health, medical, and \nadvocacy professionals. Outcomes after newborn screening may improve if \ntreatment for infantile disease is initiated before 30 days of life. Newer \nlaboratory screening and diagnostic tools can improve the speed and specificity \nof diagnosis and help facilitate this early referral. Given the rarity of Krabbe \ndisease, most recommendations were based on case series or expert opinion.\nCONCLUSION: This report updates recommendations for Krabbe disease newborn \nscreening to improve the timeliness of diagnosis and treatment of infantile \nKrabbe disease. In the United States, several states have begun or are \nconsidering Krabbe disease newborn screening. These recommendations can guide \npublic health laboratories on methodologies for screening and inform clinicians \nabout the need to promptly diagnose and treat infantile Krabbe disease.

The primary end point was \nthe percentage of patients achieving an American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 \nresponse at week 12.\nRESULTS: Overall, 283 patients were randomised and treated. At week 12, \nsignificantly more patients receiving filgotinib at any dose achieved ACR20 \nresponses versus placebo (≥65% vs 29%, p<0.001). For other key end points at \nweek 12 (ACR50, ACR70, ACR-N, Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints and C \nreactive protein, Clinical Disease Activity Index, Simplified Disease Activity \nIndex and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index) significant \ndifferences from baseline in favour of filgotinib 100 and 200 mg versus placebo \nwere seen; responses were maintained or improved through week 24. Rapid onset of \naction was observed for most efficacy end points. Dose-dependent increases in \nhaemoglobin were observed. The percentage of patients with treatment-emergent \nadverse events (TEAE) was similar in the placebo and filgotinib groups (∼40%). \nEight patients on filgotinib and one on placebo had a serious TEAE, and four \npatients, all of whom received filgotinib, experienced a serious infection. No \ntuberculosis or opportunistic infections were reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: Over 24 weeks, filgotinib as monotherapy was efficacious in \ntreating the signs and symptoms of active RA, with a rapid onset of action. \nFilgotinib was generally well tolerated.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01894516."

Analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads substantially \nincreased and improved existing 3' UTR annotations, resulting in confidently \nidentified 3' UTRs for >79% of the annotated protein-coding genes in zebrafish. \nmRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more \nthan a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages. \nThese included one of the poly(A) polymerase genes, for which alternative CPA \nreinforces its repression in the ovary. 3' UTRs tend to be shortest in the \novaries and longest in the brain. Isoforms with some of the shortest 3' UTRs are \nhighly expressed in the ovary, yet absent in the maternally contributed RNAs of \nthe embryo, perhaps because their 3' UTRs are too short to accommodate a \nuridine-rich motif required for stability of the maternal mRNA.

    "corpus_id": "26351520",
    "corpus": "BACKGROUND: Genetic recombination plays an important role in evolution, \nfacilitating the creation of new, favorable combinations of alleles and the \nremoval of deleterious mutations by unlinking them from surrounding sequences. \nIn most mammals, the placement of genetic crossovers is determined by the \nbinding of PRDM9, a highly polymorphic protein with a long zinc finger array, to \nits cognate binding sites. It is one of over 800 genes encoding proteins with \nzinc finger domains in the human genome.\nRESULTS: We report a novel technique, Affinity-seq, that for the first time \nidentifies both the genome-wide binding sites of DNA-binding proteins and \nquantitates their relative affinities. We have applied this in vitro technique \nto PRDM9, the zinc-finger protein that activates genetic recombination, \nobtaining new information on the regulation of hotspots, whose locations and \nactivities determine the recombination landscape. We identified 31,770 binding \nsites in the mouse genome for the PRDM9(Dom2) variant. Comparing these results \nwith hotspot usage in vivo, we find that less than half of potential PRDM9 \nbinding sites are utilized in vivo. We show that hotspot usage is increased in \nactively transcribed genes and decreased in genomic regions containing H3K9me2/3 \nhistone marks or bound to the nuclear lamina.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results show that a major factor determining whether a \nbinding site will become an active hotspot and what its activity will be are \nconstraints imposed by prior chromatin modifications on the ability of PRDM9 to \nbind to DNA in vivo. These constraints lead to the presence of long genomic \nregions depleted of recombination."

    "corpus_id": "11162129",
    "corpus": "Junctin is a 26 kDa membrane protein that binds to calsequestrin, triadin, and \nryanodine receptors (RyRs) within the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of \ncalcium release units. The sequence of junctin includes a short N-terminal \ncytoplasmic domain a single transmembrane domain, and a highly charged \nC-terminal domain located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen. Dog and mouse \njunctins are highly conserved at the transmembrane domains, but the luminal \ndomains are more divergent. To probe the contribution of junctin to the \narchitecture of calcium release units in heart, we engineered transgenic mice \noverexpressing canine junctin and examined the left ventricular myocardium by \nelectron microscopy. Overall architecture of calcium release units is similar in \ncontrol myocardium and in myocardium overexpressing junctin by 5-10-fold. In \nboth myocardia, junctional SR cisternae are closely associated with exterior \nmembranes (plasmalemma and transverse tubules). The cisternae are flat; they \ncontain a string of calsequestrin beads and are lined by a row of feet, or RyRs, \non the side facing the exterior membranes. T tubule surface density, measured as \nthe perimeter of T tubule profiles v area of section, is the same in transgenic \nand control myocardia (305 v 289 nm/nm(2)). Three changes affecting the \njunctional SR architecture are apparent in the myocardium overexpressing \njunctin. One is a more tightly zippered appearance of the junctional SR \ncisternae. The width of the junctional SR is narrower and less variable in \noverexpressing than in control myocardium and the calsequestrin content is more \ncompact. A second change is the extension of zippered junctional SR domains to \nnon-junctional regions, which we term \"frustrated\" junctional SR. A third change \nis an increase in the extent of association between SR and T tubules. In junctin \noverexpressing myocardium junctional SR cisternae cover approximately 45% of the \nsurface of all T tubule profiles, while in control myocardium the coverage \napproximately 30%. Junctional associations between SR and T tubules are \nincreased in size. We conclude that the increase in junctin expression affects \nthe packing of calsequestrin in the junctional SR and facilitates the \nassociation of SR and T tubules."

Whether and how periostin expression influences bone \nanabolism, however, remains unknown. We investigated the skeletal response of \nadult Postn(-/-) and Postn(+/+) mice to intermittent PTH. Compared with \nPostn(+/+), Postn(-/-) mice had a lower bone mass, cortical bone volume, and \nstrength response to PTH. PTH-stimulated bone-forming indices were all \nsignificantly lower in Postn(-/-) mice, particularly at the periosteum. \nFurthermore, in vivo stimulation of Wnt-β-catenin signaling by PTH, as evaluated \nin TOPGAL reporter mice, was inhibited in the absence of periostin \n(TOPGAL;Postn(-/-) mice). PTH stimulated periostin and inhibited MEF2C and \nsclerostin (Sost) expression in bone and osteoblasts in vitro. Recombinant \nperiostin also suppressed Sost expression, which was mediated through the \nintegrin αVβ3 receptor, whereas periostin-blocking antibody prevented inhibition \nof MEF2C and Sost by PTH. In turn, administration of a Sost-blocking antiboby \npartially restored the PTH-mediated increase in bone mass in Postn(-/-) mice. In \naddition, primary osteoblasts from Postn(-/-) mice showed a lower proliferation, \nmineralization, and migration, both spontaneously and in response to PTH. \nOsteoblastic gene expression levels confirmed a defect of Postn(-/-) osteoblast \ndifferentiation with and without PTH, as well as an increased osteoblast \napoptosis in the absence of periostin. These data elucidate the complex role of \nperiostin on bone anabolism, through the regulation of Sost, Wnt-β-catenin \nsignaling, and osteoblast differentiation."

Of a total of 885 pregnancies among the \nwomen, 397 were recorded as foetal loss/intrauterine foetal death during the \nfirst (62 %), second (25 %) or third trimester (13 %). One-hundred-and-two (25 \n%) women had had a thromboembolic event during one of their pregnancies, and 98 \n(24 %) had had pre-eclampsia on at least one occasion. Intrauterine growth \nrestriction was found in 105 (25 %) of the women, and 29 (7 %) suffered \nplacental abruption. We found that 120 (29 %) women had at least one \nthrombophilia risk factor. Factor V Leiden heterozygosity was the most common \nthrombophilia factor (n = 52), mostly linked with the risk of venous \nthromboembolism during pregnancy or postpartum and to foetal death during the \nsecond or third trimester. Fifty-three (13 %) women had antiphospholipid \nantibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anti-beta2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies) \nmainly associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion during the first \ntrimester.

Resistance to oxacillin, for S. aureus, and the \nproduction of extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), for K. pneumonia, were \ndetermined as defined by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. Also, the \npresence of vanA and vanB genes was determined in E. faecium vancomycin \n(VAN)-resistant isolates.\nRESULTS: The majority of pathogens (64.5%) isolated in the ICU unit were from \nthe ESKAPE group. The organisms most frequently isolated were A. baumannii \n(15.8%) and P. aeruginosa (14.3%). A high resistance to carbapenems was detected \nfor A. baumannii (75.3%) while 62% of S. aureus isolates were confirmed to be \nmethicillin resistant. Of the K. pneumoniae isolates, 36.9% were ESBL producers. \nWe detected three E. faecium VAN-resistant isolates, all of which contained the \nvanA gene.\nCONCLUSION: The presence of the ESKAPE group of pathogens is a major problem in \nthe ICU setting.

Mean time from \nonset of skin ulcers to diagnosis of leprosy was 17.4 months: all patients were \neither misdiagnosed or had delayed diagnosis, with seven of them presenting \ngrade 2 disability by the time of the diagnosis. Reactional states, LP or \nneuropathy as potential causes of ulcers were ruled out.

Fibrillar polymers-actin filaments, microtubules, and \nintermediate filaments-are major constituents of the cytoskeleton, which \nconstantly change their organization during cellular activities. The actin \ncytoskeleton is especially polymorphic, as actin filaments can form multiple \nhigher order assemblies performing different functions. Structural information \nabout cytoskeleton organization is critical for understanding its functions and \nmechanisms underlying various forms of cellular activity. Because of the \nnanometer-scale thickness of cytoskeletal fibers, electron microscopy (EM) is a \nkey tool to determine the structure of the cytoskeleton.

We aimed to assess the activity of \nselumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in these patients.\nMETHODS: The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium performed a multicentre, phase 2 \nstudy in patients with paediatric low-grade glioma in 11 hospitals in the USA. \nPatients aged 3-21 years with a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score greater \nthan 60 and the presence of recurrent, refractory, or progressive paediatric \nlow-grade glioma after at least one standard therapy were eligible for \ninclusion. Patients were assigned to six unique strata according to histology, \ntumour location, NF1 status, and BRAF aberration status; herein, we report the \nresults of strata 1 and 3. Stratum 1 comprised patients with WHO grade I \npilocytic astrocytoma harbouring either one of the two most common BRAF \naberrations (KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or the BRAFV600E [Val600Glu] mutation). \nStratum 3 comprised patients with any neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated \npaediatric low-grade glioma (WHO grades I and II). Selumetinib was provided as \ncapsules given orally at the recommended phase 2 dose of 25 mg/m2 twice daily in \n28-day courses for up to 26 courses. The primary endpoint was the proportion of \npatients with a stratum-specific objective response (partial response or \ncomplete response), as assessed by the local site and sustained for at least 8 \nweeks. All responses were reviewed centrally. All eligible patients who \ninitiated treatment were evaluable for the activity and toxicity analyses. \nAlthough the trial is ongoing in other strata, enrolment and planned follow-up \nis complete for strata 1 and 3. This trial is registered with \nClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01089101.\nFINDINGS: Between July 25, 2013, and June 12, 2015, 25 eligible and evaluable \npatients were accrued to stratum 1, and between Aug 28, 2013, and June 25, 2015, \n25 eligible and evaluable patients were accrued to stratum 3.

The \nmedian follow-up for the 11 patients who had not had a progression event by Aug \n9, 2018, was 36·40 months (IQR 21·72-45·59). In stratum 3, ten (40% [21-61]) of \n25 patients achieved a sustained partial response; median follow-up was 48·60 \nmonths (IQR 39·14-51·31) for the 17 patients without a progression event by Aug \n9, 2018. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were elevated \ncreatine phosphokinase (five [10%]) and maculopapular rash (five [10%]). No \ntreatment-realted deaths were reported.\nINTERPRETATION: Selumetinib is active in recurrent, refractory, or progressive \npilocytic astrocytoma harbouring common BRAF aberrations and NF1-associated \npaediatric low-grade glioma. These results show that selumetinib could be an \nalternative to standard chemotherapy for these subgroups of patients, and have \ndirectly led to the development of two Children's Oncology Group phase 3 studies \ncomparing standard chemotherapy to selumetinib in patients with newly diagnosed \npaediatric low-grade glioma both with and without NF1.\nFUNDING: National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, the \nAmerican Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, and AstraZeneca."

TSC2 encodes for the protein Tuberin, is located on chromosome 16 p13.3 and was discovered in 1993. TSC2 is contiguous with PKD1, the gene involved in one form of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Gross deletions affecting both genes may account for the 2% of individuals with TSC who also develop PKD in childhood. TSC2 has been associated with a more severe form of TSC.

However, the clinical \npicture as well as genetic testing may be complex since symptomatology is \nvariable and mutations cannot be identified in all clinically diagnosed \npatients. We present two unrelated patients with triple-A syndrome illustrating \nthe importance of alacrima as an early clinical sign.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 3.5 year old girl presented with repeated hypoglycaemic \nmyoclonic events. Adrenal insufficiency was diagnosed. In addition, alacrima, \nobvious since early infancy, was incidentally reported by the mother and finally \nlead to the clinical diagnosis of triple A syndrome. This was confirmed by \npositive mutation analysis of the AAAS gene. The second patient, an 8 months old \nboy was presented because of anisocoria and unilateral optic atrophy.

    "correct_answer": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-protein coding single-stranded RNAs (19–25 nucleotides in length) generated from  cleavage of larger non-coding RNAs by the ribonuclease III enzyme Dicer. They become part of the RNA-induced silencing complex and negatively regulate gene expression by binding to homologous 3'-UTR region of target protein-coding mRNAs as an imperfect match, causing translational repression or degradation. Approximately one-third of the protein-coding genes are susceptible to miRNA regulation. Accumulating evidence indicates that deregulated miRNA expression is associated with the onset and progression of a number of human cancers. Therefore, cancer-associated miRNAs (CA-miRNAs) could regulate target genes by acting either as \"oncogenes\" or \"tumor suppressor miRNA (TS-miRNAs)\". In line with this, numerous cancers (e.g. breast, lung, oesophageal, prostate, pancreatic, gastric and colon cancer) have been classified based on their unique miRNA expression profile.",

Functional studies indicated that ectopic expression \nof miR-22 significantly inhibits HCC cell proliferation and tumourigenicity. \nFurthermore, histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), known to have critical roles in \ncancer development, was proved to be directly targeted and regulated by miR-22. \nFurthermore, HDAC4 was upregulated in miR-22-downregulated HCC tissues, \nsuggesting that downregulation of miR-22 might participate in HCC carcinogenesis \nand progression through potentiation of HDAC4 expression.

The most important source of information for the review is human \nresearch reports published in refereed journals. A few animal studies, book \nchapters, and abstracts that are especially relevant are also included.\nRESULTS: In humans, ethanol in small doses produces cerebral vasodilation; \nhigher doses induce cerebral vasoconstriction. Chronic alcoholism is associated \nwith reduced CBF and cerebral metabolism. Sedatives and antianxiety drugs lead \nto global reduction in CBF and cerebral metabolism. Caffeine, even in small \ndoses, is a potent cerebral vasoconstrictor. Cerebral vasodilation is seen \nimmediately after cigarette smoking, but chronic smokers show global reduction \nin CBF. Changes in CBF after marijuana smoking are variable; both increases and \ndecreases are seen. Chronic marijuana smoking, however, seems to reduce CBF. \nMost inhalants and solvents are vasodilators; chronic abuse is accompanied by a \ndecrease in CBF.

Cognitive \nmeasures were also obtained.\nMETHODS: In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical \ntrial, 52 patients with Alzheimer's disease received placebo or antibody (100 mg \nevery 4 weeks, 100 mg weekly, 400 mg every 4 weeks, or 400 mg weekly) for 12 \nweeks.

Both magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \nexaminations were conducted at baseline and after the active treatment period. \nThe Aβ concentrations were measured in plasma and CSF, and the Alzheimer's \nDisease Assessment Scale-cognitive portion was administered.\nRESULTS: Clinical laboratory values, CSF cell counts, and magnetic resonance \nimaging scans were unchanged by treatment, and no adverse events could be \nclearly related to antibody administration. Total (bound to antibody and \nunbound) Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) in plasma increased in a dose-dependent manner. \nAntibody treatment similarly increased total Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) in CSF. For \npatients taking 400 mg weekly, antibody treatment decreased unbound Aβ(1-40) in \nCSF (P < .01), but increased unbound Aβ(1-42) in CSF in a dose-dependent manner. \nThe Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive portion was unchanged after \nthe 12-week antibody administration.\nCONCLUSIONS: Antibody administration was well tolerated with doses up to 400 mg \nweekly.

There are very few reports available, where expressions of \nsirtuin isoforms are comprehensively analyzed during neoplasia. Therefore, in \nthe present study, the expression of SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT7 during different \nstages of cervical cancer progression was analyzed. The normal cervical \nepithelium showed feeble expression of sirtuin isoforms, SIRT1, SIRT2, and \nSIRT7. A significant increase in SIRT1 expression was noted in the cytoplasm as \nwell as in the nucleus of proliferative layers of cervical epithelium in \nsquamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL); however, in the squamous cell carcinomas \n(SCC), a heterogeneous pattern of SIRT1 expression varying from low to high was \nnoted. A progressive increase in the expression of both SIRT2 and SIRT7 was \nnoted during cancer progression in the following order: \nnormal < preneoplasia < cancer. Cervical cancer cell lines, HeLa and SiHa, \nshowed higher levels of SIRT1 and SIRT2 in comparison to the immortalized cell \ncounterpart, HaCaT. Specific inhibitors of SIRT1 (Ex527) and SIRT2 (AGK2) \nimpaired the growth of the cervical cancer cells, SiHa, but not of the HaCaT \ncells. SIRT1 inhibition caused cell death, while SIRT2 inhibition resulted in \ncell cycle arrest. In conclusion, we report the overexpression of SIRT2 and \nSIRT7 proteins in cervical cancer and suggest probable application of sirtuin \ninhibitors as therapeutic targets.

Although tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) has been implicated in \nthe insulin resistance associated with obesity, its role in other disorders of \nobesity is largely unknown. In this report, we show that in obese (ob/ob) mice, \nneutralization of TNF-alpha or deletion of both TNF receptors (TNFRs) results in \nsignificantly reduced levels of plasma PAI-1 antigen, plasma insulin, and \nadipose tissue PAI-1 and TGF-beta mRNAs. Studies in which exogenous TNF-alpha \nwas infused into lean mice lacking individual TNFRs indicate that TNF-alpha \nsignaling of PAI-1 in adipose tissue can be mediated by either the p55 or the \np75 TNFR. However, TNF-alpha signaling of TGF-beta mRNA expression in adipose \ntissue is mediated exclusively via the p55 TNFR. Our results suggest that \nTNF-alpha is a common link between the insulin resistance and elevated PAI-1 and \nTGF-beta in obesity. The chronic elevation of TNF-alpha in obesity thus may \ndirectly promote the development of the complex cardiovascular risk profile \nassociated with this condition."

    "correct_answer": "The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) pathway in eukaryotes is an essential post-translational modification required for a variety of cellular processes, development and organelle biogenesis. SUMO-conjugating enzyme (Ubc9) is the sole conjunction enzyme in the SUMO pathway.",
    "corpus_id": "25097219",
    "corpus": "RATIONALE: Impairment of proteasomal function is pathogenic in several cardiac \nproteinopathies and can eventually lead to heart failure. Loss of proteasomal \nactivity often results in the accumulation of large protein aggregates. The \nubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is primarily responsible for cellular protein \ndegradation, and although the role of ubiquitination in this process is well \nstudied, the function of an ancillary post-translational modification, \nSUMOylation, in protein quality control is not fully understood.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the role of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9), a \nsmall ubiquitin-like modifier-conjugating enzyme, in cardiomyocyte protein \nquality control.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Gain- and loss-of-function approaches were used to \ndetermine the importance of UBC9. Overexpression of UBC9 enhanced UPS function \nin cardiomyocytes, whereas knockdown of UBC9 by small interfering RNA caused \nsignificant accumulations of aggregated protein. UPS function and relative \nactivity was analyzed using a UPS reporter protein consisting of a short degron, \nCL1, fused to the COOH-terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFPu). \nSubsequently, the effects of UBC9 on UPS function were tested in a proteotoxic \nmodel of desmin-related cardiomyopathy, caused by cardiomyocyte-specific \nexpression of a mutated αB crystallin, CryAB(R120G). CryAB(R120G) expression \nleads to aggregate formation and decreased proteasomal function. Coinfection of \nUBC9-adenovirus with CryAB(R120G) virus reduced the proteotoxic sequelae, \ndecreasing overall aggregate concentrations. Conversely, knockdown of UBC9 \nsignificantly decreased UPS function in the model and resulted in increased \naggregate levels.\nCONCLUSIONS: UBC9 plays a significant role in cardiomyocyte protein quality \ncontrol, and its activity can be exploited to reduce toxic levels of misfolded \nor aggregated proteins in cardiomyopathy."

    "corpus_id": "22889989",
    "corpus": "Mammalian dosage compensation requires silencing of one of the two X chromosomes \nin females and is controlled by the X inactivation center (Xic). Xic contains \nmany of the regulatory elements for the mutual interplay of X-inactive specific \ntranscript (Xist) and Tsix, the antisense counterpart of Xist. The regulatory \nelements control X chromosome inactivation (XCI) via the formation of DNA-DNA \nand DNA-protein complexes with cis- and trans-acting factors. However, the \nprocess-dependent regulation of Xist/Tsix by these elements in each XCI process \nremains largely unknown. In this study, a 6-thioguanine-resistant female F(1) \nhybrid mouse cell line (designated HOBMSKI2) was constructed from a cross \nbetween a female HPRT-deficient transgenic mouse (designated BM3) and a male \nwild type Mus spretus mouse (designated MS), which enabled the direct \ndiscrimination of both allele-specific expression of X-linked genes and \nallele-specific binding of proteins associated with XCI due to DNA polymorphisms \nbetween BM3 and MS. Using this cell line, we found that Tsix on the active X \nchromosome (Xa) was not expressed in somatic cells despite the fact that CTCF, \nwhich ensures Tsix expression in embryonic stem cells, was still bound to the 5' \nend of Tsix on Xa, implying that CTCF may function differently during each XCI \nprocess and its trans-activating activity for Tsix expression may be lost in the \nmaintenance process. In addition, the monoallelic expression of Tsix on Xa was \ninhibited by epigenetic modification of the chromatin in the maintenance \nprocess, which was mediated by protein complexes recruited by MeCP2. The results \nindicate the value of HOBMSKI2 in directly detecting the allele-specific binding \nof CTCF and MeCP2 to the 5' end of Tsix. The HOBMSKI2 mouse line is a versatile \nand useful resource for studying the molecular mechanism of the XCI process."

When mouse \nthymocytes were incubated with glucocorticoids, fixed, stained with propidium \niodide and analysed flow cytometrically for cell cycle distribution, a distinct \nsubpopulation of cells was observed to form below the G0/G1 region, denoted as \nthe A0 region. The presence of cells in this region was consistent with the \npresence of internucleosomal DNA fragments as determined by gel electrophoresis. \nInhibitors of transcription, translation and endonuclease activity, and a \nglucocorticoid receptor antagonist prevented accumulation of cells in this \nregion.

    "correct_answer": "AMPK activation protects cardiac structure and function by increasing cardiac autophagy in the diabetic heart.  Decreased AMPK activity and the subsequent reduction in cardiac autophagy are central to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.  In fact, dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin1 may be an important mechanism for preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy via AMPK activation that restores autophagy and protects against cardiac apoptosis. In addition, genetic inhibition of AMPK in cardiomyocytes attenuates cardiac autophagy, exacerbates cardiac dysfunction and increases mortality in diabetic mice. The modulation of AT-1R/AMPK-MAPK pathway might play crucial roles for the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and it could become an important therapeutic target to ameliorate the diabetic cardiomyopathy. Stimulation of AMPK by metformin or trimetazidine administration may represent a novel approach to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

Oxidative stress and lipid deposition were \nmarkedly increased in the myocardium, concomitant with inactivation of AMPK and \nincreased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1 \nalpha (PGC-1 alpha).

High sequencing depth can also be used to identify \nphylogenetically informative allelic variation within sequenced individuals, but \nallele sequences are infrequently assembled in phylogenetic studies. Instead, \nmany scientists perform their phylogenetic analyses using contig sequences which \nresult from the de novo assembly of sequencing reads into contigs containing \nonly canonical nucleobases, and this may reduce both statistical power and \nphylogenetic accuracy. Here, we develop an easy-to-use pipeline to recover \nallele sequences from sequence capture data, and we use simulated and empirical \ndata to demonstrate the utility of integrating these allele sequences to \nanalyses performed under the multispecies coalescent model.

    "corpus": "The reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)(q34;q11), \nPhiladelphia chromosome] creates a BCR-ABL1 fusion protein that occurs in \napproximately 95% of cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 15% of cases \nof adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 5% of adult cases of acute myeloid \nleukemia. The BCR-ABL1 protein is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase \nthat induces and maintains the neoplastic phenotype in these leukemias. \nPCR-based methods to identify and quantitate the tumor-specific BCR-ABL1 RNA \nhave been shown to be an ultrasensitive diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring \ntool for Philadelphia-positive leukemias. A novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor \n(TKI), imatinib, has been confirmed as an effective targeted treatment in most \nCML patients. However, a significant minority of patients being treated with \nimatinib develop resistance to the drug as evidenced by rising BCR-ABL1 levels. \nThe most common mechanism of resistance in these patients is the development of \nmutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (KD) that abrogate binding of imatinib. \nAlthough KD mutations are quite heterogeneous, the identification of the exact \nmutation site is clinically important, as some mutations, but not others, can be \neffectively treated with second-generation TKIs. One mutation, T315I, for \nexample, renders the leukemia resistant to all first- and second-line TKIs. \nThus, DNA sequencing of the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain in resistant patients helps \nidentify those who may benefit from a change in TKI agents, or those who should \nbe considered for other therapeutic measures, such as stem cell transplantation. \nWe describe here a method for sequencing the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain in \nperipheral blood or bone marrow of CML patients."

    "corpus": "Gaucher disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is the most \nprevalent lysosomal storage disease. Gaucher disease has marked phenotypic \nvariation and molecular heterogeneity, and seven point mutations in the acid \nbeta-glucosidase (beta-Glc) gene have been identified. By means of \nsequence-specific oligonucleotides (SSO), mutation 6433C has been detected \nhomozygously in neuronopathic type 2 (acute) and type 3 (subacute) patients, as \nwell as in children with severe visceral involvement who are apparently free of \nneuronopathic disease. To investigate the molecular basis for this puzzling \nfinding, amplified beta-Glc cDNAs from 6433C homozygous type 2 and type 3 \nGaucher disease patients were cloned and sequenced. The Swedish type 3 Gaucher \ndisease patient was truly homozygous for alleles only containing the 6433C \nmutation. In comparison, the type 2 patient contained a singly mutated 6433C \nallele and a \"complex\" allele with multiple discrete point mutations (6433C, \n6468C, and 6482C). Each of the mutations in the complex allele also was present \nin the beta-Glc pseudogene. SSO hybridization of 6433C homozygotes revealed that \nboth type 2 patients contained additional mutations in one allele, whereas the \n6433C alone was detected in both type 3 and in young severe type 1 Gaucher \ndisease patients. These results suggest that the presence of the complex allele \ninfluences the severity of neuronopathic disease in 6433C homozygotes and reveal \nthe central role played by the pseudogene in the formation of mutant alleles of \nthe beta-Glc gene. Analysis of additional cDNA clones also identified two new \nalleles in a type 3 patient, emphasizing the molecular heterogeneity of \nneuronopathic Gaucher disease."

However, there is little information \nregarding relationship between lymphangiogenesis and androgen deprivation. The \naim of this study was to clarify changes in lymphangiogenesis and VEGF \nexpression induced by androgen deprivation in prostate cancer in vivo and in \nvitro.\nMETHODS: Patients who had undergone a radical prostatectomy were enrolled in the \nstudy (NHT, n = 60 and non-NHT, n = 64). Lymph vessels were identified by D2-40 \nimmunoreactivity and lymph vessel density and lymph vessel area (LVD and LVA, \nrespectively) were measured from micrographs. The expression of VEGF-A, -B, -C, \nand -D was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The prognostic value of LVD and \nLVA for biochemical recurrence was also investigated.\nRESULTS: Mean LVD ± SD was higher in the NHT than in the non-NHT group \n(11.3 ± 3.0 vs. 7.1 ± 3.4 per high power field; P < 0.001). LVA was larger in \nthe NHT than in the non-NHT group (512.8 ± 174.9 vs. 202.7 ± 72.8 µm2 ; \nP < 0.001). VEGF-A expression was lower whereas VEGF-C and -D levels were higher \nin the NHT than in the non-NHT group.

These results were \nconfirmed by in vitro studies used androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line. \nLVA was found to be an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence in \npatients who received NHT.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that NHT stimulates lymphangiogenesis via \nupregulation of VEGF-C and -D, which may increase LVA and affect the outcome of \nprostate cancer patients.

Furthermore, BRCA1 function may contribute to enforcement of \nthe G(2) cell cycle checkpoint. E3-ubiquitin ligase activity is the only known \nenzymatic activity of BRCA1, which is mediated by the N-terminal RING finger \ndomain. The C-terminal BRCT repeat domain, which mediates protein-protein \ninteractions, is the only other identified structural domain. By investigating \ncancer-linked mutations within each domain, we demonstrate that truncation of \nthe BRCT domain greatly impairs the stability and nuclear localization of BRCA1 \nprotein. A missense mutation within the RING domain does not affect these \nbiochemical properties. However, both mutant forms of BRCA1 fail to colocalize \nin nuclear foci with the known BRCA1-interacting proteins BARD1 and BACH1, which \nare important for DNA repair. This failure occurs despite the continued ability \nof the RING mutant protein to interact with BACH1 and the ability of the BRCT \nmutant to interact with BARD1. Furthermore, neither mutant form of BRCA1 is \nrecruited into DNA damage-associated foci marked by gamma-H2AX.

Despite improved cerebral hemodynamics and \nexcellent bypass graft patency rates, COSS failed to show a benefit for the \nsurgical group with respect to ipsilateral stroke recurrence at 2 years after \ntreatment. This was due to a lower than expected rate of recurrent ipsilateral \nstroke in the medically treated group and a high rate of perioperative \nipsilateral strokes in the surgical group. Critics of the trial have cited \nsurgeon inexperience and technical difficulties related to the performance of \nthe bypass graft as a leading cause of failure of the trial.\nMETHODS: The authors retrospectively identified all patients from the COSS with \nan ipsilateral, perioperative (< 30 days) ischemic stroke after STA-MCA cortical \nbranch anastomosis. Study records, operative notes, stroke adjudication forms, \nand imaging studies were reviewed. Ischemic strokes were characterized as bypass \ngraft related or non-bypass graft related based on clinical and radiographic \nfindings.\nRESULTS: Fourteen of 93 surgically treated patients experienced an ipsilateral, \nperioperative ischemic stroke. Postoperatively, the mean oxygen extraction \nfraction (OEF) ratio between the symptomatic and asymptomatic cerebral \nhemisphere significantly improved in these patients (1.30 ± 0.18 preoperative vs \n1.12 ± 0.11 postoperative; p = 0.02), but did not normalize. In this cohort, \ntotal MCA occlusion time during the anastomosis (54.3 ± 23.5 minutes) was no \ndifferent from the MCA occlusion time in those surgical patients who did not \nhave a perioperative stroke (45.4 ± 24.2 minutes, p = 0.2). Bypass graft patency \nrates in patients with a perioperative stroke were 92% at 30 days (11 of 12 \npatients with patency data) and 83% at last follow-up visit (10 of 12 patients \nwith patency data). These patency rates were not significantly different from \nthose achieved at 30 days (100%; 76 of 76 patients with patency data; p = 0.14) \nand at last follow-up (99%; 71 of 72 patients with patency data; p = 0.052) in \npatients without a perioperative stroke. Eighty-six percent (12 of 14 patients) \nof strokes were likely attributable to factors unrelated to the STA-MCA \nanastomosis. Only 21% of strokes (3 of 14 patients) were in the territory of the \nrecipient vessel and likely related to technical performance of the anastomosis \nitself. One patient was thought to have dual stroke mechanisms.\nCONCLUSIONS: Only a small minority of ipsilateral, perioperative ischemic \nstrokes in the COSS could be attributed to technical problems of the bypass \nanastomosis. The majority of ischemic strokes could not be ascribed to this \ncause and were most likely due to patient hemodynamic fragility and the \ninability of patients to tolerate surgery."

Furthermore, most peak finders do not focus on \naccurate determination of enrichment site widths and are not widely applicable \nto different types of datasets.\nRESULTS: We developed JAMM (Joint Analysis of NGS replicates via Mixture Model \nclustering): a peak finder that can integrate information from biological \nreplicates, determine enrichment site widths accurately and resolve neighboring \nnarrow peaks. JAMM is a universal peak finder that is applicable to different \ntypes of datasets. We show that JAMM is among the best performing peak finders \nin terms of site detection accuracy and in terms of accurate determination of \nenrichment sites widths. In addition, JAMM's replicate integration improves peak \nspatial resolution, sorting and peak finding accuracy.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: JAMM is available for free and can run on Linux \nmachines through the command line: http://code.google.com/p/jamm-peak-finder."

Some Aspergillus species, like A. itaconicus and A. terreus, show the ability to synthesize this organic acid and A. terreus can secrete significant amounts to the media.

Using a lactose-based medium (LBM), \nlovastatin production was 873 mg/l on day 10, but IA production was only 22-28 \nmg/l during the cultures. When lactose in LBM was simply replaced with glucose, \nIA production was markedly enhanced by 20-fold (491 mg/l on day 5), which showed \na growth-associated pattern. The findings indicated that the carbon source used \n(glucose or lactose) controlled the biosynthetic pathway. The net yield of \nlovastatin production when using lactose was calculated to be 25.1 mg/g \n(5.1-fold) in comparison with when using glucose in the cultures. Furthermore, \nlovastatin production was further increased by 9.2% when IA (0.5 g/l) was added \nto LBM. When IA was added at 5 g/l, the fermentation broth turned dark-brown, \nand lovastatin production was reduced by 18.0%.

However, many of these have limitations, \nsuch as being limited to one viewpoint, expensive with moderate to low \nresolution, and/or requiring a large sequencing effort. Techniques like Hi-C \nprovide a genome-wide analysis. However, it requires massive sequencing effort \nwith considerable costs. Here we describe a new technique termed Targeted \nChromatin Capture (T2C), to interrogate large selected regions of the genome. \nT2C provides an unbiased view of the spatial organization of selected loci at \nsuperior resolution (single restriction fragment resolution, from 2 to 6 kbp) at \nmuch lower costs than Hi-C due to the lower sequencing effort.\nRESULTS: We applied T2C on well-known model regions, the mouse β-globin locus \nand the human H19/IGF2 locus. In both cases we identified all known chromatin \ninteractions. Furthermore, we compared the human H19/IGF2 locus data obtained \nfrom different chromatin conformation capturing methods with T2C data. We \nobserved the same compartmentalization of the locus, but at a much higher \nresolution (single restriction fragments vs. the common 40 kbp bins) and higher \ncoverage. Moreover, we compared the β-globin locus in two different biological \nsamples (mouse primary erythroid cells and mouse fetal brain), where it is \neither actively transcribed or not, to identify possible transcriptional \ndependent interactions. We identified the known interactions in the β-globin \nlocus and the same topological domains in both mouse primary erythroid cells and \nin mouse fetal brain with the latter having fewer interactions probably due to \nthe inactivity of the locus.

Nine were index \nMTC cases, 5 phaeochromocytoma, 3 Hirschsprung's disease-MEN associations and 2 \nmiscellaneous (1 neuroblastoma, 1 intestinal neuronal dysplasia), while 1 fell \ninto the MEN2B category. The remaining 19 were unaffected relatives screened for \ncarrier status, among whom afamilial recurrence was observed in 7. On genetic \ntesting, an RET point mutation at the high-risk 634 cysteine allele was \nidentified in 11 cases. A further cysteine radical mutation at the 620 position \nwas related to MEN2 in 3 families plus 1 other family referred from elsewhere. \nOther less-recognised gene variations were detected throughout the RET gene in \n70% of cases and included the 691 position on codon 11 (11 cases); the 432 \nposition (4 cases, 1 homozygous) intronic mutations on exon 4 (1 case); and an \nIVS19-37G/C and a D1017N variation in exon 19 in 2 MEN families. Fifteen MTC \npatients have had thyroidectomies, of which 2 were prophylactic (C-cell \nhyperplasia; early occult MTC). A further 3 are awaiting prophylactic surgery.\nCONCLUSION: RET gene mutation carries a risk of MEN2 and MTC in all ethnic \ngroups in South Africa. Prophylactic surgery may prevent MTC, so genetic \nscreening is important to identify and treat high-risk patients."

Here, we report the immunohistochemical \nstaining profiles of biosimilar antibodies of Solanezumab, Crenezumab and \nBapineuzumab in human formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and human fresh \nfrozen tissue. Furthermore, we performed a direct comparative \nimmunohistochemistry analysis of the biosimilar versions of the humanized \nantibodies in different mouse models including 5XFAD, Tg4-42, TBA42, APP/PS1KI, \n3xTg. The staining pattern with these humanized antibodies revealed a \nsurprisingly similar profile. All three antibodies detected plaques, cerebral \namyloid angiopathy and intraneuronal Aβ in a similar fashion. Remarkably, \nSolanezumab showed a strong binding affinity to plaques. We also reaffirmed that \nBapineuzumab does not recognize N-truncated or modified Aβ, while Solanezumab \nand Crenezumab do detect N-terminally modified Aβ peptides Aβ4-42 and \npyroglutamate Aβ3-42. In addition, we compared the results with the staining \npattern of the mouse NT4X antibody that recognizes specifically Aβ4-42 and \npyroglutamate Aβ3-42, but not full-length Aβ1-42. In contrast to the biosimilar \nantibodies of Solanezumab, Crenezumab and Bapineuzumab, the murine NT4X antibody \nshows a unique target engagement. NT4X does barely cross-react with amyloid \nplaques in human tissue. It does, however, detect cerebral amyloid angiopathy in \nhuman tissue. In Alzheimer mouse models, NT4X detects intraneuronal Aβ and \nplaques comparable to the humanized antibodies. In conclusion, the biosimilar \nantibodies Solanezumab, Crenezumab and Bapineuzumab strongly react with amyloid \nplaques, which are in contrast to the NT4X antibody that hardly recognizes \nplaques in human tissue.

Fkh1 and Fkh2 bind Fkh-activated origins, and interact physically with ORC, providing a plausible mechanism to cluster origins. Instead, we show that Fkh1 and Fkh2 are required for the clustering of early origins and their association with the key initiation factor Cdc45 in G1 phase, suggesting that Fkh1 and Fkh2 selectively recruit origins to emergent replication factories.

Existing methods, however, are not well-suited to quantitative, \ngenome-wide measurements of origin firing between strains and conditions. To \novercome this limitation, we developed qBrdU-seq, a quantitative method for BrdU \nincorporation analysis of replication dynamics, and applied it to show that \noverexpression of Fkh1 and Fkh2 advances the initiation timing of many origins \nthroughout the genome resulting in a higher total level of origin initiations in \nearly S phase. The higher initiation rate is accompanied by slower replication \nfork progression, thereby maintaining a normal length of S phase without causing \ndetectable Rad53 checkpoint kinase activation. The advancement of origin firing \ntime, including that of origins in heterochromatic domains, was established in \nlate G1 phase, indicating that origin timing can be reset subsequently to origin \nlicensing. These results provide novel insights into the mechanisms of origin \ntiming regulation by identifying Fkh1 and Fkh2 as rate-limiting factors for \norigin firing that determine the ability of replication origins to accrue \nlimiting factors and have the potential to reprogram replication timing late in \nG1 phase."

We have furthermore built a database, named Pharmaco-miR Verified Sets \n(VerSe), which contains miRNA pharmacogenomic data manually curated from the \nliterature, can be searched and downloaded via Pharmaco-miR and informs on \ntrends and generalities published in the field. Overall, we present examples of \nhow Pharmaco-miR provides possible explanations for previously published \nobservations, including how the cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil resistance induced \nby miR-148a may be caused by miR-148a targeting of the gene KIT.

    "corpus": "Assembly of compact mitotic chromosomes and resolution of sister chromatids are \ntwo essential processes for the correct segregation of the genome during \nmitosis. Condensin, a five-subunit protein complex, is thought to be required \nfor chromosome condensation. However, recent genetic analysis suggests that \ncondensin is only essential to resolve sister chromatids. To study further the \nfunction of condensin we have depleted DmSMC4, a subunit of the complex, from \nDrosophila S2 cells by dsRNA-mediated interference. Cells lacking DmSMC4 \nassemble short mitotic chromosomes with unresolved sister chromatids where \nBarren, a non-SMC subunit of the complex is unable to localise. Topoisomerase \nII, however, binds mitotic chromatin after depletion of DmSMC4 but it is no \nlonger confined to a central axial structure and becomes diffusely distributed \nall over the chromatin. Furthermore, cell extracts from DmSMC4 dsRNA-treated \ncells show significantly reduced topoisomerase II-dependent DNA decatenation \nactivity in vitro. Nevertheless, DmSMC4-depleted chromosomes have centromeres \nand kinetochores that are able to segregate, although sister chromatid arms form \nextensive chromatin bridges during anaphase. These chromatin bridges do not \nresult from inappropriate maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion by DRAD21, a \nsubunit of the cohesin complex. Moreover, depletion of DmSMC4 prevents premature \nsister chromatid separation, caused by removal of DRAD21, allowing cells to exit \nmitosis with chromatin bridges.

In this study, we investigated the functional interplay between \nskeletal muscle- and BAT-based thermogenesis under mild versus severe cold \nadaptation by employing UCP1-/- and SLN-/- mice. Interestingly, adaptation of \nSLN-/- mice to mild cold conditions (16 °C) significantly increased UCP1 \nexpression, suggesting increased reliance on BAT-based thermogenesis. This was \nalso evident from structural alterations in BAT morphology, including \nmitochondrial architecture, increased expression of electron transport chain \nproteins, and depletion of fat droplets. Similarly, UCP1-/- mice adapted to mild \ncold up-regulated muscle-based thermogenesis, indicated by increases in muscle \nsuccinate dehydrogenase activity, SLN expression, mitochondrial content, and \nneovascularization, compared with WT mice. These results further confirm that \nSLN-based thermogenesis is a key player in muscle non-shivering thermogenesis \n(NST) and can compensate for loss of BAT activity. We also present evidence that \nthe increased reliance on BAT-based NST depends on increased autonomic input, as \nindicated by abundant levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y.

It \nhas been noted that longer absent words might also be of interest, but the \nexisting algorithms only provide generic absent words by trivially extending the \nshortest ones.\nRESULTS: We show how absent words relate to the repetitions and structure of the \ndata, and define a new and larger class of absent words, called minimal absent \nwords, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words \nintroduced in recent works. The words of this new class are minimal in the sense \nthat if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting \nword is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating \nminimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An \nimplementation of this algorithm is publicly available at \nftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws.\nCONCLUSION: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much \nlarger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful \nfor applications that require a richer variety of absent words. Nevertheless, \nthe number of minimal absent words is still manageable since it grows at most \nlinearly with the string size, unlike generic absent words that grow \nexponentially. Both the algorithm and the concepts upon which it depends shed \nadditional light on the structure of absent words and complement the existing \nstudies on the topic."

In addition, treatment of osteoporosis with a \nbisphosphonate was less effective in patients with vitamin D deficiency. Calcium \nand vitamin D supplementation is a key component of prevention and treatment of \nosteoporosis unless calcium intake and vitamin D status are optimal. For primary \ndisease prevention, supplementation should be targeted to those with dietary \ninsufficiencies. Several serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) cut-offs have been \nproposed to define vitamin D insufficiency (as opposed to adequate vitamin D \nstatus), ranging from 30 to 100 nmol/l. Based on the relationship between serum \n25(OH)D, BMD, bone turnover, lower extremity function and falls, we suggest that \n50 nmol/l is the appropriate serum 25(OH)D threshold to define vitamin D \ninsufficiency. Supplementation should therefore generally aim to increase \n25(OH)D levels within the 50-75 nmol/l range. This level can be achieved with a \ndose of 800 IU/day vitamin D, the dose that was used in successful fracture \nprevention studies to date; a randomized clinical trial assessing whether higher \nvitamin D doses achieve a greater reduction of fracture incidence would be of \nconsiderable interest. As calcium balance is not only affected by vitamin D \nstatus but also by calcium intake, recommendations for adequate calcium intake \nshould also be met.

Simulation \nand portal films of the whole-brain irradiation (WBI) fields were \nretrospectively reviewed in 77 patients.

However, both these diseases may be ideal for novel \nimmunotherapies targeting the cancer-testis antigen, NY-ESO-1.\nAREAS COVERED: In this review, we discuss the novel NY-ESO-1 targeted vaccine \nregimen, CMB305. This regimen uses a unique integration-deficient, \ndendritic-cell targeting lentiviral vector from the ZVex® platform, LV305, in \norder to prime NY-ESO-1 specific T cells. LV305 has single agent activity, and, \nin one case, caused a durable partial response in a refractory SS patient. \nCMB305 also includes a boost from a NY-ESO-1 protein vaccine given along with a \npotent toll-like-4 receptor agonist, glycopyranosyl lipid A. CMB305 induces \nNY-ESO-1 specific T cell responses in both SS and MRC patients and these \npatients had excellent overall survival (OS) outcomes in the initial phase I \nstudy.\nEXPERT COMMENTARY: CMB305 is a therapeutic vaccine regimen targeting NY-ESO-1 \nbased on the lentiviral vaccine vector, LV305. Phase I studies have proven this \nvaccine is active immunologically. Data suggesting this vaccine may improve OS \nfor SS and MRCL patients is exciting but early, and on-going work is testing the \nimpact of CMB305 on patient outcomes."

    "correct_answer": "Recent studies have identified genes involved in high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans. Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment.  A gene (HMOX2) involved in heme catabolism, harbors potentially adaptive variants in Tibetans.",

    "corpus": "Tibetans are well adapted to high-altitude hypoxic conditions, and in recent \ngenome-wide scans, many candidate genes have been reported involved in the \nphysiological response to hypoxic conditions. However, the limited sequence \nvariations analyzed in previous studies would not be sufficient to identify \ncausal mutations. Here we conducted resequencing of the entire genomic region \n(59.4 kb) of the hypoxic gene EGLN1 (one of the top candidates from the \ngenome-wide scans) in Tibetans and identified 185 sequence variations, including \n13 novel variations (12 substitutions and 1 insertion or deletion). There is a \nnonsynonymous mutation (rs186996510, D4E) showing surprisingly deep divergence \nbetween Tibetans and lowlander populations (Fst = 0.709 between Tibetans and Han \nChinese). It is highly prevalent in Tibetans (70.9% on average) but extremely \nrare in Han Chinese, Japanese, Europeans, and Africans (0.56-2.27%), suggesting \nthat it might be the causal mutation of EGLN1 contributing to high-altitude \nhypoxic adaptation. Neutrality test confirmed the signal of Darwinian positive \nselection on EGLN1 in Tibetans. Haplotype network analysis revealed a \nTibetan-specific haplotype, which is absent in other world populations. The \nestimated selective intensity (0.029 for the C allele of rs186996510) puts EGLN1 \namong the known genes that have undergone the strongest selection in human \npopulations, and the onset of selection was estimated to have started at the \nearly Neolithic (∼8,400 years ago). Finally, we detected a significant \nassociation between rs186996510 and hemoglobin levels in Tibetans, suggesting \nthat EGLN1 contributes to the adaptively low hemoglobin level of Tibetans \ncompared with acclimatized lowlanders at high altitude."

We also \ndemonstrate that p110α is the principal isoform activated downstream of the \nβ-adrenergic receptor (β-AR), another important signalling pathway in metabolic \nregulation, through a mechanism involving activation of the cAMP effector \nmolecule EPAC1. This study offers further insights in the role of PI3K isoforms \nin the regulation of energy metabolism with implications for the therapeutic \napplication of selective inhibitors of these isoforms."

We evaluated the \nefficacy and safety of dupilumab (SAR231893/REGN668), a fully human monoclonal \nantibody to the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor, in patients with \npersistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels.\nMETHODS: We enrolled patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and a \nblood eosinophil count of at least 300 cells per microliter or a sputum \neosinophil level of at least 3% who used medium-dose to high-dose inhaled \nglucocorticoids plus long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs). We administered \ndupilumab (300 mg) or placebo subcutaneously once weekly. Patients were \ninstructed to discontinue LABAs at week 4 and to taper and discontinue inhaled \nglucocorticoids during weeks 6 through 9. Patients received the study drug for \n12 weeks or until a protocol-defined asthma exacerbation occurred. The primary \nend point was the occurrence of an asthma exacerbation; secondary end points \nincluded a range of measures of asthma control. Effects on various type 2 helper \nT-cell (Th2)-associated biomarkers and safety and tolerability were also \nevaluated.\nRESULTS: A total of 52 patients were assigned to the dupilumab group, and 52 \npatients were assigned to the placebo group. Baseline characteristics were \nsimilar in the two groups. Three patients had an asthma exacerbation with \ndupilumab (6%) versus 23 with placebo (44%), corresponding to an 87% reduction \nwith dupilumab (odds ratio, 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.28; \nP<0.001). Significant improvements were observed for most measures of lung \nfunction and asthma control. Dupilumab reduced biomarkers associated with \nTh2-driven inflammation. Injection-site reactions, nasopharyngitis, nausea, and \nheadache occurred more frequently with dupilumab than with placebo.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated \neosinophil levels who used inhaled glucocorticoids and LABAs, dupilumab therapy, \nas compared with placebo, was associated with fewer asthma exacerbations when \nLABAs and inhaled glucocorticoids were withdrawn, with improved lung function \nand reduced levels of Th2-associated inflammatory markers.

    "question": "What is the role of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) in hematopoiesis?",
    "correct_answer": "LSD1 represents a central regulator of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. LSD1 knockdown (LSD1-kd) expanded progenitor numbers by enhancing their proliferative behavior. LSD1-kd led to an extensive expansion of granulomonocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors. In contrast, terminal granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis and platelet production were severely inhibited. The only exception was monopoiesis, which was promoted by LSD1 deficiency. Importantly, we showed that peripheral blood granulocytopenia, monocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia were reversible after LSD1-kd termination. Extramedullary splenic hematopoiesis contributed to the phenotypic reversion, and progenitor populations remained expanded. LSD1-kd was associated with the upregulation of key hematopoietic genes, including Gfi1b, Hoxa9 and Meis1, which are known regulators of the HSC/progenitor compartment. We also demonstrated that LSD1-kd abrogated Gfi1b-negative autoregulation by crossing LSD1-kd with Gfi1b:GFP mice. There is also epigenetic regulation of hematopoietic differentiation by Gfi-1 and Gfi-1b that is mediated by the cofactors CoREST and LSD1. A short Gfi-1B isoform controls erythroid differentiation by recruiting the LSD1-CoREST complex through the dimethylation of its SNAG domain. The enzymatic domain of LSD1 plays an important role in repressing the TAL1-directed transcription of GAL4 reporter linked to a thymidine kniase minimal promoter. Furthermore,  the TAL1-associated LSD1, HDAC1, and their enzymatic activities are coordinately down-regulated during the early phases of erythroid differentiation. Consistent with the rapid changes of TAL1-corepressor complex during differentiation, TAL1 recruits LSD1 to the silenced p4.2 promoter in undifferentiated, but not in differentiated, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of LSD1 in MEL cells resulted in derepression of the TAL1 target gene accompanied by increasing dimeH3K4 at the promoter region. Thus, it appears that histone lysine demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate TAL1-mediated transcription and that the dynamic regulation of TAL1-associated LSD1/HDAC1 complex may determine the onset of erythroid differentiation programs. Furthermore, RUNX1 has been shown to be part of a large transcription factor complex, together with LDB1, GATA1, TAL1, and ETO2 in erythroid cells. RUNX1 interacts with LSD1 and MYEF2 in erythroid cells. MYEF2 is bound in undifferentiated cells and is lost upon differentiation, whereas LSD1 is bound in differentiated cells. Finally, LSD1 also participates in the trans-repressive effects of SALL4. Based on luciferase assays, the amine oxidase domain of LSD1 is important in suppressing SALL4-mediated reporter transcription. In freshly isolated adult mouse bone marrows, both SALL4 and LSD1 proteins are preferentially expressed in undifferentiated progenitor cells and co-localize in the nuclei. Further sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that these two factors share the same binding sites at the promoter regions of important hematopoietic regulatory genes including EBF1, GATA1, and TNF.",

Circular \ndichroism and UV spectral analysis demonstrated that mitochondrial G-rich \nsequences near deletion breakpoints prevalent in human disease form G-quadruplex \nDNA structures. A biochemical analysis of purified recombinant human Twinkle \nprotein (gene product of c10orf2) showed that the mitochondrial replicative \nhelicase inefficiently unwinds well characterized intermolecular and \nintramolecular G-quadruplex DNA substrates, as well as a unimolecular G4 \nsubstrate derived from a mitochondrial sequence that nests a deletion breakpoint \ndescribed in human renal cell carcinoma. Although G4 has been implicated in the \ninitiation of mitochondrial DNA replication, our current findings suggest that \nmitochondrial G-quadruplexes are also likely to be a source of instability for \nthe mitochondrial genome by perturbing the normal progression of the \nmitochondrial replication machinery, including DNA unwinding by Twinkle \nhelicase."

    "corpus_id": "15989601",
    "corpus": "Valaciclovir (Valtrex, Zelitrex), the L-valine ester of aciclovir, increases \naciclovir bioavailability by 3- to 5-fold over that achievable with oral \naciclovir. It addresses many unmet needs of currently available anti-herpesvirus \ntherapies. Valaciclovir extends the efficacy of aciclovir in the treatment of \nherpes zoster and genital HSV infections, using less frequent dose regimens but \nretaining the highly acceptable safety profile established for aciclovir. The \npotential for valaciclovir in CMV prophylaxis has now been proven, and further \nrefining to identify the optimal dose regimen is ongoing. After oral \nadministration, valaciclovir is rapidly absorbed and extensively converted to \naciclovir and L-valine, the essential amino acid. The mode of action and \nspectrum of antiviral activity of valaciclovir are thus identical to aciclovir. \nThe bioavailability of aciclovir after valaciclovir, characterised from studies \nin healthy adult volunteers, is similar in a wide range of patient populations, \nincluding the elderly, those with advanced HIV disease, patients with impaired \nliver or renal function, or undergoing bone marrow transplantation. No \nclinically significant drug interactions with valaciclovir have so far been \nidentified. Dosage reductions in clinical use of valaciclovir are only necessary \nwhen renal function is severely impaired. In controlled clinical trials in \nherpes zoster, valaciclovir (1000 mg three times daily) is superior to aciclovir \nin speeding the resolution of zoster-associated pain and post-herpetic \nneuralgia. It is as effective as aciclovir in hastening rash healing. In \npatients with ophthalmic zoster, no differences were evident between \nvalaciclovir and aciclovir treatment on zoster-associated pain or the occurrence \nof ocular complications. The safety profiles of valaciclovir, aciclovir and \nplacebo were not different in this study programme. In a series of controlled, \nrandomised trials of valaciclovir, aciclovir and placebo for the acute treatment \nof genital HSV infections in approximately 3000 patients, twice daily \nvalaciclovir was proven as effective as the standard 5 times daily aciclovir \nregimen in resolving the clinical signs and symptoms of lesional disease. Early \npatient-initiated valaciclovir therapy (500 mg twice daily) of recurrent genital \nherpes episodes was shown significantly to increase the chance of prevention of \nvesicular or ulcerative lesions, a valuable clinical advantage not prospectively \nproven for aciclovir. When used for periods of up to one year, valaciclovir (500 \nmg once daily) effectively suppresses genital herpes recurrences. Long-term \nstudies of valaciclovir for HSV suppression, evaluating doses of up to 1000 mg \ndaily in approximately 3000 patients, about 25% of whom were HIV seropositive \n(CD+ > 100 cells/microl), revealed a highly acceptable clinical tolerability \nprofile for valaciclovir that did not differ from aciclovir or placebo. There \nwere no cases resembling thrombotic microangiopathy in these long-term studies. \nThe aciclovir safety heritage and pharmacokinetic rationale for the development \nof valaciclovir have been realised through the clinical research programmes in \nthe zoster and HSV indications. Further studies in these and related areas, \nincluding CMV prophylaxis, are in progress and aim to expand further the \nclinical potential of valaciclovir in the future."

It is best classified as \na type of plasma cell dyscrasia with paraneoplastic manifestations, similar to \nPOEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, and \nskin abnormalities). To date, 11 patients have been identified.

Seven bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from \nthree patients, including two post-treatment marrows, were examined. Patients \nwere 36, 49, and 49 years old at time of diagnosis. In all cases, erythropoietin \nlevels were extremely elevated at >5000 IU/l, the paraprotein was IgG kappa, \nJAK2 V617F was negative and vascular endothelial growth factor levels were \nnormal. In one case, the increase in clonal plasma cells reached levels of \nsmoldering myeloma (18%), but remaining marrows showed few monoclonal plasma \ncells (<5%). All pre-treatment biopsies showed erythroid hyperplasia, with mild \nnonspecific megakaryocytic, and erythroid cytologic atypia in one marrow. \nProminent plasma cell vacuolization and reactive-appearing lymphoid aggregates \nwere noted in one case. Findings of myeloproliferative neoplasms, including \nmegakaryocyte clusters and fibrosis, were not identified. In conclusion, TEMPI \nsyndrome should be considered when erythrocytosis and plasma cell dyscrasia \ncoexist. The bone marrow findings, although nonspecific, differ significantly \nfrom polycythemia vera. Peculiar clinical and laboratorial findings of TEMPI, \nincluding elevated erythropoietin and normal vascular endothelial growth factor \nlevel, allow the diagnosis and distinction from POEMS syndrome.

Eligible participants were of \neither gender aged between 3 weeks and 7 months old with onset of spinal \nmuscular atrophy symptoms between 3 weeks and 6 months, who had SMN1 homozygous \ngene deletion or mutation. Safety assessments included adverse events, physical \nand neurological examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, \ncerebrospinal fluid laboratory tests, and electrocardiographs. Clinical efficacy \nassessments included event free survival, and change from baseline of two \nassessments of motor function: the motor milestones portion of the Hammersmith \nInfant Neurological Exam-Part 2 (HINE-2) and the Children's Hospital of \nPhiladelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) motor function \ntest, and compound motor action potentials.

HINE-2, \nCHOP-INTEND, and compound motor action potential were compared between baseline \nand last visit using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Age at death or permanent \nventilation was compared with natural history using the log-rank test. The study \nis registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01839656.\nFINDINGS: 20 participants were enrolled between May 3, 2013, and July 9, 2014, \nand assessed through to an interim analysis done on Jan 26, 2016. All \nparticipants experienced adverse events, with 77 serious adverse events reported \nin 16 participants, all considered by study investigators not related or \nunlikely related to the study drug. In the 12 mg dose group, incremental \nachievements of motor milestones (p<0·0001), improvements in CHOP-INTEND motor \nfunction scores (p=0·0013), and increased compound muscle action potential \namplitude of the ulnar nerve (p=0·0103) and peroneal nerve (p<0·0001), compared \nwith baseline, were observed.

The strikingly more severe course of WD \nis caused by genetic defects of LAL that leave no residual enzymatic activity. \nMutations at the exon 8/intron 8 transition of the LAL gene have been identified \nin several CESD and WD patients and are responsible for the manifestation of the \ndisease. We have determined the genetic defect in a 3-month-old boy of African \norigin affected by WD. No enzymatic activity of the lysosomal acid lipase was \ndetectable in white blood cells and cultured fibroblasts. Analysis of his LAL \ncDNA and genomic DNA revealed that he was homozygous for a mutation at position \n-3 of the exon 8 splice donor site. A C-->T transition leads to a nonsense codon \nand to a premature termination of the LAL protein at amino acid 277. Due to this \nmutation, a shorter LAL mRNA species was also generated that lacked exon 8 and \nwas deficient of the nonsense codon. As a consequence, the protein synthesis \nproceeded to the natural termination codon, but the enzyme generated had an \ninternal deletion of 24 amino acids (254-277) and was also inactive. These \nfindings, together with our previous observations when analyzing the mutations \nin WD and CESD patients lead to the conclusion that the more severe WD is due to \nmutations that absolutely abolish lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) enzyme activity \nand the cholesteryl ester storage disease phenotype is due to mutations that \nallow some residual LAL activity to be manifested."

Innervated adult fast and slow skeletal myofibers \nshow Panx1 reactivity in close proximity to dihydropyridine receptors in the \nsarcolemma of T-tubules.

Panx1 channels play a relevant role in \npotentiation of muscle contraction because they allow release of ATP and uptake \nof glucose, two molecules required for this response. In support of this notion, \nthe absence of Panx1 abrogates the potentiation of muscle contraction elicited \nby repetitive electrical stimulation, which is reversed by exogenously applied \nATP. Phosphorylation of Panx1 Thr and Ser residues might be involved in Panx1 \nchannel activation since it is enhanced during potentiation of muscle \ncontraction. Under denervation, Panx1 levels are upregulated and this partially \nexplains the reduction in electrochemical gradient, however its absence does not \nprevent denervation-induced atrophy but prevents the higher oxidative state. \nPanx1 also forms functional channels at the cell surface of myotubes and their \nfunctional state has been associated with intracellular Ca(2+) signals and \nregulation of myotube plasticity evoked by electrical stimulation.

The loss of nuclear translocation \nactivity of S28N and P112L is caused by changes in the folding of the residues \n(31)RRR(33) that result in the reduction in solvent accessible surface area \n(SASA).

    "corpus": "Over the past decade, bupropion has become a major pharmacotherapy for smoking \ncessation in the Western world. Unlike other smoking cessation \npharmacotherapies, bupropion is a non-nicotine treatment. Compared with a \nplacebo control, bupropion approximately doubles smoking quit rates. Most \nsmoking cessation pharmacotherapies are thought to work, in part, by reducing \nnicotine withdrawal and craving. This article reviews preclinical, human \nlaboratory and clinical trial studies of the effect of bupropion on nicotine \nwithdrawal and craving. Preclinical studies demonstrate that in rats undergoing \nnicotine withdrawal, bupropion can dose-dependently lower changes in \nbrain-reward threshold and somatic signs of nicotine withdrawal. Human \nlaboratory studies have demonstrated that bupropion can alleviate some nicotine \nwithdrawal symptoms, including depressed mood, irritability, difficulty \nconcentrating and increased appetite. Moreover, bupropion has shown some \nefficacy in alleviating craving to smoke. Clinical trials of bupropion have \noffered mixed support of its ability to reduce nicotine withdrawal, weight gain \nduring treatment and craving. Strong mediational evidence of bupropion's action \nthrough relief of withdrawal and craving in smoking cessation is growing. \nGreater understanding of the psychological mechanisms of bupropion action will \nlikely be obtained through advances in the conceptualization and measurement of \nwithdrawal and craving. Improvements in the efficacy of bupropion may be \nachieved through pharmacogenetic studies, with particular emphasis on its \nmetabolites. Ultimately, the efficacy of bupropion may be augmented by \ncombination with other agents that target withdrawal and craving through \ncomplementary neurobiological processes."

In this line, administration of spermidine rescued α-synuclein-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD, in nematodes.

Two α-Syn variants, the \nwild-type (WT) protein and A30P, were studied.

The tolerability profile was favorable for all active \ntreatments.\nCONCLUSION: Opicapone, a novel third generation COMT inhibitor, when compared to \nentacapone, provides a superior response upon the bioavailability of levodopa \nassociated to more pronounced, long-lasting, and sustained COMT inhibition. The \ntolerability profile was favorable. On the basis of the results presented in \nthis study and along with the earlier pharmacology studies, it is anticipated \nthat opicapone adjunct therapy at the dosages of 25 and 50 mg will provide an \nenhancement in levodopa availability that will translate into clinical benefit \nfor Parkinson's disease patients."

Although closely similar, \nthey can be distinguished by subtle clinical features and their pattern \ninheritance. WMS is characterized by the presence of dislocation of \nmicrospherophakia and has autosomal dominant or recessive mode of inheritance. \nGD is the more severe one, with a progressive cardiac valvular thickening, \ntracheal stenosis, bronchopulmonary insufficiency, often leading to an early \ndeath. AD has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, distinct facial and \nskeleton features (a hoarse voice and internal notch of the femoral head). \nFinally, MS is sporadic, characterized by prognathism, deafness, developmental \ndelay, thickened calvarium, and large vertebrae with short and large pedicles. \nWe first identified mutations in Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) in the dominant form of WMS \nand then mutations in A Disintegrin-like And Metalloproteinase domain with \nThromboSpondin type 1 repeats 10 (ADAMTS10) in the recessive form of WMS. The \nfunction of ADAMTS10 is unknown but these findings support a direct interaction \nbetween ADAMTS10 and FBN1. We then identified mutations in ADAMTSL2 in the \nrecessive form of GD and a hotspot of mutations in FBN1 in the dominant form of \nGD and in AD (exon 41-42, encoding TGFβ binding protein-like domain 5 (TB5) of \nFBN1). The function of ADAMTSL2 is unknown. Using a yeast double hybrid screen, \nwe identified latent transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) binding protein 1 as a \npartner of ADAMTSL2. We found an increased level of active TGFβ in the \nfibroblast medium from patients with FBN1 or ADAMTSL2 mutations and an enhanced \nphosphorylated SMAD2 level, allowing us to conclude at an enhanced TGFβ \nsignaling in GD and AD. Finally, a direct interaction between ADAMTSL2 and FBN1 \nwas demonstrated suggesting a dysregulation of FBN1/ADAMTSL2 interrelationship \nas the underlying mechanism of the short stature phenotypes. Using exome \nsequencing in MS probands, we identified de novo SMAD4 missense mutations, all \ninvolving isoleucine residue at position 500, in the MH2 domain. In MS \nfibroblasts, we found decreased ubiquitination level of SMAD4 and increased \nlevel of SMAD4 supporting a stabilization of SMAD4 protein. Functional SMAD4 is \nrequired for canonical signal transduction through the oligomerization with \nphosphorylated SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5/8. We therefore studied the nuclear \nlocalization of mutant SMAD complexes and found that the complexes translocate \nto the nucleus. We finally observed a decreased expression of downstream TGFβ \ntarget genes supporting impaired TGFβ driven transcriptional control in MS. Our \nfindings support a direct link between the short stature phenotypes and the TGFβ \nsignaling. However, the finding of enhanced TGFβ signaling in Marfan phenotypes \nsupports the existence of yet unknown mechanisms regulating TGFβ action."

Lingual epithelium of female mice (CBA \nX GPDX) heterozygous for G6PD deficiency showed multiple clearly defined patches \nof strong or weak enzyme activity, corresponding in intensity to the strong \nstaining uniformly present in the normal parental strain (CBA) or to the weak \nstaining uniformly present in the G6PD deficient parental strain (GPDX). This \npattern results from the random suppression of either the paternal or the \nmaternal X chromosome in each cell early in embryonic development, and the \nsubsequent inheritance of X inactivation in daughter cells, giving rise to \nphenotypic patches each composed of one or more clones. The patch borders \nintersected the base of the lingual epithelium at small indentations or at the \napices of connective tissue papillae; the surface intersection in some cases \nbisected filiform papillae. Patch width measured in tissue sections at the mid \nrete ridge level, showed a clear mode close to 40 microns, corresponding very \nclosely to the mode for rete ridge width (i.e. distance between connective \ntissue papillae). Further evidence for clonal organization was obtained by \ninducing mutations in the lingual epithelium of CBA mice by topical mutagen \napplication. A few clearly defined patches of enzyme loss were found with a mean \ndiameter of 36 microns. Their morphology was very similar to that of patches in \nthe heterozygous animals. We interpret these patches as clones derived from stem \ncells with induced somatic G6PD mutations. We conclude that the mouse lingual \nepithelium is a stem cell epithelium composed of clonal units of about 40 \nmicrons diameter, based on the rete ridge structure and that both connective \ntissue papillae and filiform papillae occur at the junction of two or more \nepithelial clones."

Ceftriaxone \nelevated EAAT2 transcription in PHFA through the nuclear factor-kappaB \n(NF-kappaB) signaling pathway.

By Western blot analysis, we proved that the TTV \nORF2 protein did not alter the level of NF-kappaB expression but prevented the \np50 and p65 subunits from entering the nucleus due to the inhibition of \nIkappaBalpha protein degradation. Further immunoprecipitation assays showed that \nthe TTV ORF2 protein could physically interact with IKKbeta as well as IKKalpha, \nbut not IKKgamma.

Continuous EGFR inhibition of first-generation \nresistant tumors by sequential treatment with afatinib plus/minus cetuximab, \nfollowed by osimertinib, represented an effective therapeutic strategy in this \nmodel. Whereas T790M resistance mutation was not detected, a major mechanism of \nacquired resistance was the activation of components of the Hedgehog (Hh) \npathway. This phenomenon was accompanied by epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition. Cell lines established in vitro from gefitinib-, or afatinib- or \nosimertinib-resistant tumors showed metastatic properties and maintained \nEGFR-TKIs resistance in vitro, that was reverted by the combined blockade of Hh, \nwith the selective SMO inhibitor sonidegib, and EGFR.\nCONCLUSIONS: EGFR-mutant NSCLC can benefit from continuous treatment with \nEGFR-inhibitors, indepenently from mechanisms of resistance. In a complex and \nheterogenous scenario, Hh showed an important role in mediating resistance to \nEGFR-inhibitors through the induction of mesenchymal properties."

Nasuia retains genes enabling synthesis of \ntwo amino acids, DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Both symbionts \nhave lost genes underlying ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation, \npossibly as a consequence of the enriched sugar content of phloem. Shared \ngenomic features, including reassignment of the UGA codon from Stop to \ntryptophan, and phylogenetic results suggest that Nasuia-ALF is most closely \nrelated to Zinderia, the betaproteobacterial symbiont of spittlebugs. Thus, \nNasuia/Zinderia and Sulcia likely represent ancient associates that have \nco-resided in hosts since the divergence of leafhoppers and spittlebugs >200 Ma, \nand possibly since the origin of the Auchenorrhyncha, >260 Ma."

The blood–brain barrier is formed by brain endothelial cells and it allows the passage of water, some gases, and lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion, as well as the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids that are crucial to neural function.",

    "corpus": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is composed of brain capillary endothelial cells \nand has an important role in maintaining homeostasis of the brain separating the \nblood from the parenchyma of the central nervous system (CNS). It is widely \nknown that disruption of the BBB occurs in various neurodegenerative diseases, \nincluding Alzheimer's disease (AD). Annexin A1 (ANXA1), an anti-inflammatory \nmessenger, is expressed in brain endothelial cells and regulates the BBB \nintegrity. However, its role and mechanism for protecting BBB in AD have not \nbeen identified. We found that β-Amyloid 1-42 (Aβ42)-induced BBB disruption was \nrescued by human recombinant ANXA1 (hrANXA1) in the murine brain endothelial \ncell line bEnd.3. Also, ANXA1 was decreased in the bEnd.3 cells, the capillaries \nof 5XFAD mice, and the human serum of patients with AD. To find out the \nmechanism by which ANXA1 recovers the BBB integrity in AD, the RhoA-ROCK \nsignaling pathway was examined in both Aβ42-treated bEnd.3 cells and the \ncapillaries of 5XFAD mice as RhoA was activated in both cases. RhoA inhibitors \nalleviated Aβ42-induced BBB disruption and constitutively overexpressed RhoA-GTP \n(active form of RhoA) attenuated the protective effect of ANXA1. When pericytes \nwere cocultured with bEnd.3 cells, Aβ42-induced RhoA activation of bEnd.3 cells \nwas inhibited by the secretion of ANXA1 from pericytes. Taken together, our \nresults suggest that ANXA1 restores Aβ42-induced BBB disruption through \ninhibition of RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway and we propose ANXA1 as a therapeutic \nreagent, protecting against the breakdown of the BBB in AD."

Like normal nascent chromatin, chromatin labeled for brief periods \n(0.5-1 min) in the presence of butyrate was more sensitive to digestion with \nDNase I and micrococcal nuclease than control bulk chromatin. However, chromatin \nreplicated in butyrate did not mature as in normal replication, but instead \nretained approximately 50% of its heightened sensitivity to DNase I. Incubation \nof mature chromatin in butyrate for 1 h did not induce DNase I sensitivity: \ntherefore, the presence of sodium butyrate was required during replication to \npreserve the increased digestibility of nascent chromatin DNA. In contrast, \nsodium butyrate did not inhibit or retard the maturation of newly replicated \nchromatin when assayed by micrococcal nuclease digestion, as determined by the \nfollowing criteria: 1) digestion to acid solubility, 2) rate of conversion to \nmononucleosomes, 3) repeat length, and 4) presence of non-nucleosomal DNA. \nConsistent with the properties of chromatin replicated in butyrate, micrococcal \nnuclease also did not preferentially attack the internucleosomal linkers of \nchromatin regions acetylated in vivo. The observation of a novel chromatin \nreplication intermediate, which is highly sensitive to DNase I but possesses \nnormal resistance to micrococcal nuclease, suggests that nucleosome assembly and \nhistone deacetylation are not obligatorily coordinated. Thus, while \ndeacetylation is required for chromatin maturation, histone acetylation \napparently affects chromatin organization at a level distinct from that of core \nparticle or linker, possibly by altering higher order structure."

These feature vectors \ncan be easily combined with machine-learning algorithms to develop computational \npredictors and analysis methods for various tasks in bioinformatics and system \nbiology. It is anticipated that the Pse-in-One web server will become a very \nuseful tool in computational proteomics, genomics, as well as biological \nsequence analysis. Moreover, to maximize users' convenience, its stand-alone \nversion can also be downloaded from \nhttp://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/Pse-in-One/download/, and directly run on \nWindows, Linux, Unix and Mac OS."

Therefore, the identification of and prophylactic therapy \n(i.e., defibrillator placement) in patients with HCM who are at risk of dying \nare imperative.\nMETHODS: Two-hundred forty-three consecutive patients with HCM were \nprospectively enrolled. All patients underwent initial CMR, and 220 were \navailable for clinical follow-up. The mean follow-up time was 1,090 days after \nCMR. End points were all-cause and cardiac mortality.\nRESULTS: During follow-up 20 of the 220 patients died, and 2 patients survived \nsudden cardiac death due to adequate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator \ndischarge. Most events (n = 16) occurred for cardiac reasons; the remaining 6 \nevents were related to cancer and accidents. Our data indicate that the presence \nof scar visualized by CMR yields an odds ratio of 5.47 for all-cause mortality \nand of 8.01 for cardiac mortality. This might be superior to classic clinical \nrisk factors, because in our dataset the presence of 2 risk factors yields an \nodds ratio of 3.86 for all-cause and of 2.20 for cardiac mortality, \nrespectively.

The identification of cancers \nwith a significant adenosine drive is critical to understand the potential for \nthese molecules. However, it is challenging to measure tumor adenosine levels at \nscale, thus novel, clinically tractable biomarkers are needed.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated a gene expression signature for the adenosine \nsignaling using regulatory networks derived from the literature and validated \nthis in patients. We applied the signature to large cohorts of disease from The \nCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and cohorts of immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated \npatients.\nRESULTS: The signature captures baseline adenosine levels in vivo (r 2 = 0.92, P \n= 0.018), is reduced after small-molecule inhibition of A2AR in mice (r 2 = \n-0.62, P = 0.001) and humans (reduction in 5 of 7 patients, 70%), and is \nabrogated after A2AR knockout. Analysis of TCGA confirms a negative association \nbetween adenosine and overall survival (OS, HR = 0.6, P < 2.2e-16) as well as \nprogression-free survival (PFS, HR = 0.77, P = 0.0000006). Further, adenosine \nsignaling is associated with reduced OS (HR = 0.47, P < 2.2e-16) and PFS (HR = \n0.65, P = 0.0000002) in CD8+ T-cell-infiltrated tumors. Mutation of TGFβ \nsuperfamily members is associated with enhanced adenosine signaling and worse OS \n(HR = 0.43, P < 2.2e-16). Finally, adenosine signaling is associated with \nreduced efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in published cohorts (HR = 0.29, P = \n0.00012).\nCONCLUSIONS: These data support the adenosine pathway as a mediator of a \nsuccessful antitumor immune response, demonstrate the prognostic potential of \nthe signature for immunotherapy, and inform patient selection strategies for \nadenosine pathway modulators currently in development."

    "corpus": "BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicates that neuropathic pain is a \nneuro-immune disorder with enhanced activation of the immune system. Recent data \nprovided proof that neuropathic pain patients exhibit increased numbers of \nimmunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs), which may represent an endogenous \nattempt to limit inflammation and to reduce pain levels. We here investigate the \nmolecular mechanisms underlying these alterations.\nMETHODS: Our experimental approach includes functional analyses of primary human \nT cells, 3'-UTR reporter assays, and expression analyses of neuropathic pain \npatients' samples.\nRESULTS: We demonstrate that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the \ndifferentiation of Tregs in neuropathic pain. We identify miR-124a and miR-155 \nas direct repressors of the histone deacetylase sirtuin1 (SIRT1) in primary \nhuman CD4(+) cells. Targeting of SIRT1 by either specific siRNA or by these two \nmiRNAs results in an increase of Foxp3 expression and, consecutively, of \nanti-inflammatory Tregs (siRNA: 1.7 ± 0.4; miR-124a: 1.5 ± 0.4; miR-155: \n1.6 ± 0.4; p < 0.01). As compared to healthy volunteers, neuropathic pain \npatients exhibited an increased expression of miR-124a (2.5 ± 0.7, p < 0.05) and \nmiR-155 (1.3 ± 0.3; p < 0.05) as well as a reduced expression of SIRT1 \n(0.5 ± 0.2; p < 0.01). Moreover, the expression of these two miRNAs was \ninversely correlated with SIRT1 transcript levels.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in neuropathic pain, enhanced targeting \nof SIRT1 by miR-124a and miR-155 induces a bias of CD4(+) T cell differentiation \ntowards Tregs, thereby limiting pain-evoking inflammation. Deciphering \nmiRNA-target interactions that influence inflammatory pathways in neuropathic \npain may contribute to the discovery of new roads towards pain amelioration.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trial Register DRKS00005954."

Additionally, we examined possible connections between the oxidative \ndamage of DNA and involvement of the error-prone DNA polymerase (Pol)V homologue \nRulAB in stationary-phase mutagenesis in P. putida. Our results demonstrated \nthat the GO repair enzymes MutY, MutM, and MutT are involved in the prevention \nof base substitution mutations in carbon-starved P. putida. Interestingly, the \nantimutator effect of MutT was dependent on the growth phase of bacteria. \nAlthough the lack of MutT caused a strong mutator phenotype under carbon \nstarvation conditions for bacteria, only a twofold increased effect on the \nfrequency of mutations was observed for growing bacteria. This indicates that \nMutT has a backup system which efficiently complements the absence of this \nenzyme in actively growing cells. The knockout of MutM affected only the \nspectrum of mutations but did not change mutation frequency. Dps is known to \nprotect DNA from oxidative damage. We found that dps-defective P. putida cells \nwere more sensitive to sudden exposure to hydrogen peroxide than wild-type \ncells. At the same time, the absence of Dps did not affect the accumulation of \nmutations in populations of starved bacteria. Thus, it is possible that the \nprotective role of Dps becomes essential for genome integrity only when bacteria \nare exposed to exogenous agents that lead to oxidative DNA damage but not under \nphysiological conditions. Introduction of the Y family DNA polymerase PolV \nhomologue rulAB into P. putida increased the proportion of A-to-C and A-to-G \nbase substitutions among mutations, which occurred under starvation conditions. \nSince PolV is known to perform translesion synthesis past damaged bases in DNA \n(e.g., some oxidized forms of adenine), our results may imply that adenine \noxidation products are also an important source of mutation in starving \nbacteria."

The total estimated \nextrathyroidal T3 production, 44 nmol/d, is in close agreement with the 40 nmol \nT3/d based on previous kinetic studies. D2-generated T3 production accounts for \napproximately 71% of the peripheral T3 production in hypothyroidism, but D1 for \napproximately 67% in thyrotoxic patients.

    "corpus": "INTRODUCTION: Despite significant progress, a disease-modifying therapy for \nAlzheimer's disease (AD) has not yet been developed. Recent findings implicate \nsoluble oligomeric amyloid beta as the most relevant protein conformation in AD \npathogenesis. We recently described a signaling cascade whereby oligomeric \namyloid beta binds to cellular prion protein on the neuronal cell surface, \nactivating intracellular Fyn kinase to mediate synaptotoxicity. Fyn kinase has \nbeen implicated in AD pathophysiology both in in vitro models and in human \nsubjects, and is a promising new therapeutic target for AD. Herein, we present a \nPhase Ib trial of the repurposed investigational drug AZD0530, a Src family \nkinase inhibitor specific for Fyn and Src kinase, for the treatment of patients \nwith mild-to-moderate AD.\nMETHODS: The study was a 4-week Phase Ib multiple ascending dose, randomized, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled trial of AZD0530 in AD patients with \nMini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores ranging from 16 to 26. A total of 24 \nsubjects were recruited in three sequential groups, with each randomized to \nreceive oral AZD0530 at doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 125 mg, or placebo daily for \n4 weeks. The drug:placebo ratio was 3:1. Primary endpoints were safety, \ntolerability, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of AZD0530. Secondary \nendpoints included changes in clinical efficacy measures (Alzheimer's Disease \nAssessment Scale - cognitive subscale, MMSE, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative \nStudy - Activities of Daily Living Inventory, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and \nClinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes) and regional cerebral glucose \nmetabolism measured by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.\nRESULTS: AZD0530 was generally safe and well tolerated across doses. One subject \nreceiving 125 mg of AZD0530 was discontinued from the study due to the \ndevelopment of congestive heart failure and atypical pneumonia, which were \nconsidered possibly related to the study drug. Plasma/CSF ratio of AZD0530 was \n0.4. The 100 mg and 125 mg doses achieved CSF drug levels corresponding to brain \nlevels that rescued memory deficits in transgenic mouse models. One-month \ntreatment with AZD0530 had no significant effect on clinical efficacy measures \nor regional cerebral glucose metabolism.\nCONCLUSIONS: AZD0530 is reasonably safe and well tolerated in patients with \nmild-to-moderate AD, achieving substantial central nervous system penetration \nwith oral dosing at 100-125 mg. Targeting Fyn kinase may be a promising \ntherapeutic approach in AD, and a larger Phase IIa clinical trial of AZD0530 for \nthe treatment of patients with AD has recently launched.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01864655.

Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT) is an uncommon type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT).

Evidence from human and animal studies attributes BVT to alternating ectopic foci originating from the distal His-Purkinje system in the left and/or right ventricle, respectively.

However, significant barriers \nremain for the translation of these vectors into widely available therapies. In \nparticular, exposure to the AAV capsid can generate an immune response of \nneutralizing antibodies. One approach to overcome this response is to map the \nAAV-specific neutralizing epitopes and rationally design an AAV capsid able to \nevade neutralization. To accomplish this, we isolated a monoclonal antibody \nagainst AAV9 following immunization of BALB/c mice and hybridoma screening. This \nantibody, PAV9.1, is specific for intact AAV9 capsids and has a high \nneutralizing titer of >1:160,000. We used cryo-electron microscopy to \nreconstruct PAV9.1 in complex with AAV9. We then mapped its epitope to the \n3-fold axis of symmetry on the capsid, specifically to residues 496-NNN-498 and \n588-QAQAQT-592. Capsid mutagenesis demonstrated that even a single amino acid \nsubstitution within this epitope markedly reduced binding and neutralization by \nPAV9.1. In addition, in vivo studies showed that mutations in the PAV9.1 epitope \nconferred a \"liver-detargeting\" phenotype to the mutant vectors, unlike AAV9, \nindicating that the residues involved in PAV9.1 interactions are also \nresponsible for AAV9 tropism. However, we observed minimal changes in binding \nand neutralizing titer when we tested these mutant vectors for evasion of \npolyclonal sera from mice, macaques, or humans previously exposed to AAV. Taken \ntogether, these studies demonstrate the complexity of incorporating mapped \nneutralizing epitopes and previously identified functional motifs into the \ndesign of novel capsids able to evade immune response.IMPORTANCE Gene therapy \nutilizing viral vectors has experienced recent success, culminating in U.S. Food \nand Drug Administration approval of the first adeno-associated virus vector gene \ntherapy product in the United States: Luxturna for inherited retinal dystrophy. \nHowever, application of this approach to other tissues faces significant \nbarriers. One challenge is the immune response to viral infection or vector \nadministration, precluding patients from receiving an initial or readministered \ndose of vector, respectively. Here, we mapped the epitope of a novel \nneutralizing antibody generated in response to this viral vector to design a \nnext-generation capsid to evade immune responses. Epitope-based mutations in the \ncapsid interfered with the binding and neutralizing ability of the antibody but \nnot when tested against polyclonal samples from various sources. Our results \nsuggest that targeted mutation of a greater breadth of neutralizing epitopes \nwill be required to evade the repertoire of neutralizing antibodies responsible \nfor blocking viral vector transduction."

    "corpus": "Phospholemman (FXYD1) is a single-transmembrane protein regulator of \nNa,K-ATPase, expressed strongly in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain and \nphosphorylated by protein kinases A and C at Ser-68 and Ser-63, respectively. \nBinding of FXYD1 reduces Na,K-ATPase activity, and phosphorylation at Ser-68 or \nSer-63 relieves the inhibition. Despite the accumulated information on \nphysiological effects, whole cell studies provide only limited information on \nmolecular mechanisms. As a complementary approach, we utilized purified human \nNa,K-ATPase (α1β1 and α2β1) reconstituted with FXYD1 or mutants S63E, S68E, and \nS63E,S68E that mimic phosphorylation at Ser-63 and Ser-68. Compared with control \nα1β1, FXYD1 reduces Vmax and turnover rate and raises K0.5Na. The phosphomimetic \nmutants reverse these effects and reduce K0.5Na below control K0.5Na. Effects on \nα2β1 are similar but smaller. Experiments in proteoliposomes reconstituted with \nα1β1 show analogous effects of FXYD1 on K0.5Na, which are abolished by \nphosphomimetic mutants and also by increasing mole fractions of DOPS in the \nproteoliposomes. Stopped-flow experiments using the dye RH421 show that FXYD1 \nslows the conformational transition E2(2K)ATP → E1(3Na)ATP but does not affect \n3NaE1P → E2P3Na. This regulatory effect is explained simply by molecular \nmodeling, which indicates that a cytoplasmic helix (residues 60-70) docks \nbetween the αN and αP domains in the E2 conformation, but docking is weaker in \nE1 (also for phosphomimetic mutants). Taken together with previous work showing \nthat FXYD1 also raises binding affinity for the Na(+)-selective site III, these \nresults provide a rather comprehensive picture of the regulatory mechanism of \nFXYD1 that complements the physiological studies."

    "correct_answer": "Breast cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the breast become abnormal and multiply without control or order to form a tumor. The most common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the ducts that carry milk to the nipple (ductal cancer). Other forms of breast cancer begin in the glands that produce milk (lobular cancer) or in other parts of the breast.\nEarly breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include a lump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of the breast; nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and skin irritation, dimpling, or scaliness. These changes can occur as part of many different conditions, however. Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a person definitely has breast cancer.\nIn some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. If breast cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the bones, liver, lungs, or brain. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers.\nA small percentage of all breast cancers cluster in families. Hereditary cancers are those associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary breast cancers tend to occur earlier in life than noninherited (sporadic) cases and are more likely to involve both breasts.\n\nVariations of the BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCT, and P53 genes increase the risk of developing breast cancer.\nThe and NFR2, HER2 and TOP2A genes are associated with breast cancer.",

    "corpus": "INTRODUCTION: Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers are considered \nprognostically more favorable than ER-negative tumors, whereas human epidermal \ngrowth factor receptor (HER)2/neu-positive breast cancers are associated with \nworse prognosis. The objective of the present study was to determine whether \nER-positive and ER-negative status relates to epigenetic changes in breast \ncancer-related genes. To evaluate epigenetic differences in tumor-related genes \nrelating to ER and HER2/neu status of primary tumors, we examined the promoter \nmethylation status of the promoter region CpG islands of eight major breast \ntumor-related genes (RASSF1A, CCND2, GSPT1, TWIST, APC, NES1, RARbeta2, and \nCDH1).\nMETHODS: Paired ER-positive (n = 65) and ER-negative (n = 65) primary breast \ntumors (n = 130) matched for prognostic factors were assessed. DNA was extracted \nfrom paraffin-embedded tumor tissue after microdissection, and \nmethylation-specific PCR and capillary-array electrophoresis analysis were \nperformed.\nRESULTS: In early stages of tumor progression (T1 and N0), RASSF1A and CCND2 \nwere significantly (P < 0.05) more methylated in ER-positive than in ER-negative \ntumors. GSTP1 hypermethylation was more frequent in the lymph node metastasis \npositive group than in the negative group. Double negative (ER-negative, \nHER2/neu-negative) breast cancers had significantly lesser frequencies of \nRASSF1A, GSTP1, and APC methylation (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, and P = 0.0035, \nrespectively). Both ER and HER2/neu status correlated independently with these \nepigenetic alterations.\nCONCLUSION: We demonstrated significant differences in tumor-related gene \nmethylation patterns relevant to ER and HER2/neu status of breast tumors. This \nmay be of significance in the assessment of targeted therapy resistance related \nto ER and HER2/neu status in breast cancer patients."

The \nkainate/AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor (GRIK = glutamate receptor, \nionotropic, kainate) plays a critical role in synaptic potentiation, which is an \nessential process for learning and memory. Among the five known GRIK family \nmembers, haploinsufficiency of GRIK1, GRIK2, and GRIK4 are known to cause \ndevelopmental delay, whereas the roles of GRIK3 and GRIK5 remain unknown. \nHerein, we report on a girl who presented with a severe developmental delay \npredominantly affecting her language and fine motor skills. She had a 2.6-Mb \nmicrodeletion in 1p34.3 involving GRIK3, which encodes a principal subunit of \nthe kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor. Given its strong expression \npattern in the central nervous system and the biological function of GRIK3 in \npresynaptic neurotransmission, the haploinsufficiency of GRIK3 is likely to be \nresponsible for the severe developmental delay in the proposita. A review of \ngenetic alterations and the phenotypic effects of all the GRIK family members \nsupport this hypothesis. The current observation of a microdeletion involving \nGRIK3, a kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit, and the \nneurodevelopmental manifestation in the absence of major dysmorphism provides \nfurther clinical implication of the possible role of GRIK family glutamate \nreceptors in the pathogenesis of developmental delay."

In the phase 3, 2-year FREEDOMS (FTY720 Research \nEvaluating Effects of Daily Oral therapy in MS) study, fingolimod significantly \nreduced annualised relapse rates (ARRs) and the risk of confirmed disability \nprogression compared with placebo. We aimed to investigate whether the \nbeneficial treatment effect reported for the overall population is consistent in \nsubgroups of patients with different baseline characteristics.\nMETHODS: We did subgroup analyses of ARRs (primary outcome) and confirmed \ndisability progression (a secondary outcome) over 24 months in the FREEDOMS \nstudy, a randomised, double-blind study that included 1272 patients with \nrelapsing-remitting MS who were assigned 1:1:1 to fingolimod (0·5 mg or 1·25 mg) \nor placebo once daily for 24 months.

    "corpus_id": "23279204",
    "corpus": "Upon exposure to various environmental stresses such as arsenite, hypoxia, and \nheat shock, cells inhibit their translation and apoptosis and then repair \nstress-induced alterations, such as DNA damage and the accumulation of misfolded \nproteins. These types of stresses induce the formation of cytoplasmic RNA \ngranules called stress granules (SGs). SGs are storage sites for the many mRNAs \nreleased from disassembled polysomes under these stress conditions and are \nessential for the selective translation of stress-inducible genes. \nRas-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is a \ncomponent of SGs that initiates the assembly of SGs by forming a multimer. In \nthis study, we examined the role of G3BP2, a close relative of G3BP1, in SG \nformation. Although single knockdown of either G3BP1 or G3BP2 in 293T cells \npartially reduced the number of SG-positive cells induced by arsenite, the \nknockdowns of both genes significantly reduced the number. G3BP2 formed a \nhomo-multimer and a hetero-multimer with G3BP1. Moreover, like G3BP1, the \noverexpression of G3BP2 induced SGs even without stress stimuli. Collectively, \nthese results suggest that both G3BP1 and G3BP2 play a role in the formation of \nSGs in various human cells and thereby recovery from these cellular stresses."

The aim of this study was to compare \nrobotic-assisted laparoscopic Heller myotomy (RAHM) with laparoscopic Heller \nmyotomy (LHM) in terms of efficacy and safety. Thirty-one patients with \ndiagnosis of achalasia confirmed by esophagogram and manometry were included. \nDysphagia and weight loss were the main complaints in both groups. 18 patients \nwere treated with LHM and 13 patients with RAHM. There was no difference in mean \noperative time (76 ± 13 vs. 79 ± 20 min; P = 0.73). Intraoperative complications \nwere less frequent in the robotic-assisted procedures (5.5% vs. 0%); however, \nthis was a non-significant difference. 94.5-100% of patients had relief of their \nsymptoms. We conclude that RAHM is a safe and effective procedure.

The \nspectrum of abnormality ranges from a relatively normal looking contraction to \nchaotic repetitive contractions akin to a jackhammer. Although previous studies \nhave shown an uncertain correlation between peristaltic vigor and symptoms, we \nhypothesize that symptoms may be more severe with repetitive contractions as \nopposed to an elevated contractile measure. Thus, this study aims to investigate \nwhether symptom severity is related to the contraction pattern in the patients \nwith hypercontractile esophagus.\nMETHODS: Patients with hypercontractile esophagus were retrospectively \nidentified, their demographic and high-resolution manometry characteristics were \ncollected. Contraction pattern on high-resolution manometry was categorized into \nsingle-peak and multiple-peak. Comparison was performed between patients with \nsingle-peak and multiple-peak.\nRESULTS: Altogether 35 patients (age range, 45-70 years; female:male, 24:11) \nwere included. Seven patients presented with single-peak hypercontractile \nswallows, while 28 patients presented with multiple-peak hypercontractile \nswallows.

S1P receptors have become an attractive \npharmacological target to interfere with S1P-mediated cellular responses, which \ncontribute to various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

Novel \nS1PR modulators are now being developed with a more selective receptor \nactivation profile and improved pharmacokinetic characteristics. In this review, \nwe will summarize the state-of-the-art approaches that target directly or \nindirectly S1P signaling and may be useful as novel strategies to treat \nautoimmune and inflammatory diseases."

    "correct_answer": "We find that the power to reject ancient admixture might be particularly low if the population size of Homo sapiens was comparable to the Neanderthal population size. Our results indicate that 3.6% of the Neanderthal genome is shared with roughly 65.4% of the average European gene pool, which clinally diminishes with distance from Europe.",
    "corpus_id": "27038113",
    "corpus": "Approximately 2-4% of genetic material in human populations outside Africa is \nderived from Neanderthals who interbred with anatomically modern humans. Recent \nstudies have shown that this Neanderthal DNA is depleted around functional \ngenomic regions; this has been suggested to be a consequence of harmful \nepistatic interactions between human and Neanderthal alleles. However, using \npublished estimates of Neanderthal inbreeding and the distribution of mutational \nfitness effects, we infer that Neanderthals had at least 40% lower fitness than \nhumans on average; this increased load predicts the reduction in Neanderthal \nintrogression around genes without the need to invoke epistasis. We also predict \na residual Neanderthal mutational load in non-Africans, leading to a fitness \nreduction of at least 0.5%. This effect of Neanderthal admixture has been left \nout of previous debate on mutation load differences between Africans and \nnon-Africans. We also show that if many deleterious mutations are recessive, the \nNeanderthal admixture fraction could increase over time due to the protective \neffect of Neanderthal haplotypes against deleterious alleles that arose recently \nin the human population. This might partially explain why so many organisms \nretain gene flow from other species and appear to derive adaptive benefits from \nintrogression."

The validity of the prognostic scores was assessed on the basis of \ntheir correlation with survival. For various primary malignancies, new scoring \ncriteria were applied in each system according to the survival results obtained \nin this study. Each revised scoring system was adjusted with a similar principle \nof scoring as described previously. Patient survival according to each \npreoperative factor was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The predictive \nvalue of each scoring system was evaluated by the log-rank test and Cox \nregression analysis.\nRESULTS: The interval from the diagnosis of the primary malignancy to that of \nspinal metastasis (p = 0.023) and the interval from the diagnosis of spinal \nmetastasis to surgery (p = 0.039) were significantly correlated with survival. \nRegarding Tokuhashi scores, the correlation coefficient was 0.790 before \nadjustment (p = 0.001) and 0.853 after adjustment (p < 0.001). For Tomita \nscores, the correlation coefficient was -0.994 (p < 0.001) both before and after \nadjustment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tomita scores more accurately predicted survival than Tokuhashi \nscores.

Novel therapeutic approaches aiming to improve the \natheroprotective functions of High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) include the use of \nreconstituted HDL forms containing human apolipoprotein A-I (rHDL-apoA-I). Given \nthe strong atheroprotective properties of apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3), rHDL-apoE3 \nmay represent an attractive yet largely unexplored therapeutic agent.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the atheroprotective potential of rHDL-apoE3 starting \nwith the unbiased assessment of global transcriptome effects and focusing on \nendothelial cell (EC) migration as a critical process in re-endothelialization \nand atherosclerosis prevention. The cellular, molecular and functional effects \nof rHDL-apoE3 on EC migration-associated pathways were assessed, as well as the \npotential translatability of these findings in vivo.\nMETHODS: Human Aortic ECs (HAEC) were treated with rHDL-apoE3 and total RNA was \nanalyzed by whole genome microarrays. Expression and phosphorylation changes of \nkey EC migration-associated molecules were validated by qRT-PCR and Western blot \nanalysis in primary HAEC, Human Coronary Artery ECs (HCAEC) and the human \nEA.hy926 EC line. The capacity of rHDL-apoE3 to stimulate EC migration was \nassessed by wound healing and transwell migration assays. The contribution of \nMEK1/2, PI3K and the transcription factor ID1 in rHDL-apoE3-induced EC migration \nand activation of EC migration-related effectors was assessed using specific \ninhibitors (PD98059: MEK1/2, LY294002: PI3K) and siRNA-mediated gene silencing, \nrespectively. The capacity of rHDL-apoE3 to improve vascular permeability and \nhypercholesterolemia in vivo was tested in a mouse model of hypercholesterolemia \n(apoE KO mice) using Evans Blue assays and lipid/lipoprotein analysis in the \nserum, respectively.\nRESULTS: rHDL-apoE3 induced significant expression changes in 198 genes of HAEC \nmainly involved in re-endothelialization and atherosclerosis-associated \nfunctions. The most pronounced effect was observed for EC migration, with 42/198 \ngenes being involved in the following EC migration-related pathways: 1) MEK/ERK, \n2) PI3K/AKT/eNOS-MMP2/9, 3) RHO-GTPases, 4) integrin. rHDL-apoE3 induced changes \nin 24 representative transcripts of these pathways in HAEC, increasing the \nexpression of their key proteins PIK3CG, EFNB2, ID1 and FLT1 in HCAEC and \nEA.hy926 cells. In addition, rHDL-apoE3 stimulated migration of HCAEC and \nEA.hy926 cells, and the migration was markedly attenuated in the presence of \nPD98059 or LY294002. rHDL-apoE3 also increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, \nAKT, eNOS and p38 MAPK in these cells, while PD98059 and LY294002 inhibited \nrHDL-apoE3-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT and p38 MAPK, respectively. LY \nhad no effect on rHDL-apoE3-mediated eNOS phosphorylation. ID1 siRNA markedly \ndecreased EA.hy926 cell migration by inhibiting rHDL-apoE3-triggered ERK1/2 and \nAKT phosphorylation. Finally, administration of a single dose of rHDL-apoE3 in \napoE KO mice markedly improved vascular permeability as demonstrated by the \nreduced concentration of Evans Blue dye in tissues such as the stomach, the \ntongue and the urinary bladder and ameliorated hypercholesterolemia.\nCONCLUSIONS: rHDL-apoE3 significantly enhanced EC migration in vitro, \npredominantly via overexpression of ID1 and subsequent activation of MEK1/2 and \nPI3K, and their downstream targets ERK1/2, AKT and p38 MAPK, respectively, and \nimproved vascular permeability in vivo. These novel insights into the rHDL-apoE3 \nfunctions suggest a potential clinical use to promote re-endothelialization and \nretard development of atherosclerosis."

Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low \nintensity (1 ? 2 V/cm), intermediate frequency (100 ? 200 kHz) alternating \nelectric fields administered using insulated electrodes placed on the skin \nsurrounding the region of a malignant tumor. TTFields were shown to destroy \ncells within the process of mitosis via apoptosis, thereby inhibiting tumor \ngrowth. TTFields have no effect on non-dividing cells.\nAREAS COVERED: This article reviews in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies, \ndemonstrating the activity of TTFields both as a monotherapy as well as in \ncombination with several cytotoxic agents. Furthermore, it summarizes the \nclinical experience with TTFields, mainly in two indications: one in recurrent \nglioblastoma multiforme: in a large prospective randomized Phase III trial \nTTFields was compared with best standard care (including chemotherapy): TTFields \nsignificantly improved median overall survival (OS) compared with standard \ntherapy (7.8 vs 6.1 months) for the patients treated per protocol. Importantly, \nquality of life was also better in the TTFields group. The second indication was \na Phase II study in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, where TTFields was \nadministered concomitantly with pemetrexed. This combination resulted in an \nexcellent median OS of 13.8 months. Interestingly, the progression-free survival \n(PFS) within the area of the TTFields was 28, however, outside the TTFields the \nPFS was only 22 weeks.\nEXPERT OPINION: The proof of concept of TTFields has been well demonstrated in \nthe preclinical setting, and the clinical data seem promising in various tumor \ntypes. The side effects of TTFields were minimal and in general consisted of \nskin reaction to the electrodes. There are a number of ways in which TTFields \ncould be further evaluated, for example, in combination with chemotherapy, as a \nmaintenance treatment, or as a salvage therapy if radiotherapy or surgery is not \npossible. While more clinical data are clearly needed, TTFields is an emerging \nand promising novel treatment concept."

Most HOT regions \nco-localize with RNA polymerase II binding sites, but many are not near the \npromoters of annotated genes. At HOT promoters, TF occupancy is strongly \npredictive of transcription preinitiation complex recruitment and moderately \npredictive of initiating Pol II recruitment, but only weakly predictive of \nelongating Pol II and RNA transcript abundance. TF occupancy varies \nquantitatively within human HOT regions; we used this variation to discover \nnovel associations between TFs. The sequence motif associated with any given \nTF's direct DNA binding is somewhat predictive of its empirical occupancy, but a \ngreat deal of occupancy occurs at sites without the TF's motif, implying \nindirect recruitment by another TF whose motif is present.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mammalian HOT regions are regulatory hubs that integrate the \nsignals from diverse regulatory pathways to quantitatively tune the promoter for \nRNA polymerase II recruitment."

Among the various mitogenic signaling pathways involved in SMC \nproliferation, the mTOR pathway regulates both the cell cycle and cell growth. \nResveratrol, a polyphenolic compound from grapes and red wine, has potential \nanti-atherogenic and anti-cancer properties. This work was designed to \ninvestigate the activation of the mTOR pathway by the proatherogenic oxidized \nLDL (oxLDL) in SMC, and the potential inhibitory effect of resveratrol.\nRESULTS: mTOR and its downstream target p70S6 kinase are phosphorylated and \nactivated by mitogenic concentrations of oxLDL (50 microg/ml), and are involved \nin SMC proliferation, as assessed by the inhibitory effect of the mTOR inhibitor \nrapamycin. The activation of mTOR signaling by oxLDL, requires the upstream \nactivation of PI3K and Akt, as assessed by the inhibitory effect of the PI3K \ninhibitor Ly294002 on mTOR activation and DNA synthesis. Resveratrol blocked the \noxLDL-induced phosphorylation and activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway \nand strongly inhibited both the DNA synthesis and proliferation of SMC. This \nactivity is independent of the anti-oxidant effect and of AMPK activation by \nresveratrol.\nCONCLUSION: These data indicate that the mTOR pathway is activated by oxLDL via \nPI3K/PDK1/Akt, and is required for SMC proliferation. Resveratrol blocks \nspecifically this pathway, thereby inhibiting oxLDL-induced SMC proliferation. \nThese data highlight a new property for resveratrol that could contribute to the \ngeneral anti-atherogenic properties of this polyphenol."

It \ncan be treated by corticosteroid injection, splinting and surgery.\nOBJECTIVES: To summarise evidence on the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid \ninjections for de Quervain's tenosynovitis.\nSEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central \nRegister of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), \nMEDLINE (1966 to April 2009), EMBASE (1956 to April 2009), CINAHL (1982 to April \n2009), AMED (1985 to April 2009), DARE, Dissertation Abstracts and PEDro \n(physiotherapy evidence database).\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and controlled clinical trials evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's \ntenosynovitis.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: After screening abstracts of studies identified by \nthe search we obtained full text articles of studies which fulfilled the \nselection criteria. We extracted data using a predefined electronic form. We \nassessed the methodological quality of included trials by using the checklist \ndeveloped by Jadad and the Delphi list. We extracted data on the primary outcome \nmeasures: treatment success; severity of pain or tenderness at the radial \nstyloid; functional impairment of the wrist or hand; and outcome of \nFinkelstein's test, and the secondary outcome measures: proportion of patients \nwith side effects; type of side effects and patient satisfaction with injection \ntreatment.\nMAIN RESULTS: We found one controlled clinical trial of 18 participants (all \npregnant or lactating women) that compared one steroid injection with \nmethylprednisolone and bupivacaine to splinting with a thumb spica. All patients \nin the steroid injection group (9/9) achieved complete relief of pain whereas \nnone of the patients in the thumb spica group (0/9) had complete relief of pain, \none to six days after intervention (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = \n1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 1.2). No side effects or local \ncomplications of steroid injection were noted.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of corticosteroid injections for de \nQuervain's tenosynovitis has been studied in only one small controlled clinical \ntrial, which found steroid injections to be superior to thumb spica splinting. \nHowever, the applicability of our findings to daily clinical practice is \nlimited, as they are based on only one trial with a small number of included \nparticipants, the methodological quality was poor and only pregnant and \nlactating women participated in the study.

Then, the CG-MD simulation studies focused on the \nmolecular insight into the dissociation dynamics of SpA-hIgG1 complex at pH 3.0. \nIt is found that there are four steps in the dissociation process of the \ncomplex. First, there is a slight conformational adjustment of helix II in SpA. \nThis is followed by the phenomena that the electrostatic interactions provided \nby the three hot spots (Glu143, Arg146 and Lys154) of helix II of SpA break up, \nleading to the dissociation of helix II from the binding site of hIgG1. \nSubsequently, breakup of the hydrophobic interactions between helix I (Phe132, \nTyr133 and His137) in SpA and hIgG1 occurs, resulting in the disengagement of \nhelix I from its binding site of hIgG1. Finally, the non-specific interactions \nbetween SpA and hIgG1 decrease slowly till disappearance, leading to the \ncomplete dissociation of the SpA-hIgG1 complex.

Here, we report that hamartin is \nlocalized to the centrosome and that phosphorylated hamartin and phosphorylated \ntuberin co-immunoprecipitate with the mitotic kinase Plk1. Plk1 interacts with \nthe N-terminus of hamartin (amino acids 1-880), which contains two potential \nPlk1-binding sites (T310 and S332). Phosphorylated hamartin interacts with Plk1 \nindependent of tuberin with all three proteins present in a complex. A \nnon-phosphorylatable hamartin mutant with an alanine substitution at residue \nT310 does not interact with Plk1, whereas a non-phosphorylatable hamartin mutant \nat residue S332 in conjunction with alanine mutations at the other CDC2/cyclin \nB1 sites (T417, S584 and T1047) does not impact hamartin binding to Plk1. \nHamartin negatively regulates the protein levels of Plk1. Finally, Tsc1(-/-) \nmouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have increased number of centrosomes and \nincreased DNA content, compared to Tsc1(+/+) cells. Both phenotypes are rescued \nafter pre-treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.

In patients with cancer, Type D personality is associated with poor quality of life and mental health. Cancer patients with a Type D personality as compared with non-Type D patients perceive that they receive less information, report less satisfaction with the amount of received information, believe that their illness has significantly more serious consequences, will last significantly longer, and experience significantly more symptoms that they attribute to their illness. Also, they are more concerned about their illness, and their disease more often influences them emotionally.

Patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2009, as registered in the \nEindhoven Cancer Registry, received a questionnaire on Type D personality (DS14) \nand illness perceptions (B-IPQ); 81% (n=3977) responded.\nRESULTS: 750 (19%) patients had a Type D personality. They believe their illness \nhas significantly more serious consequences, will last significantly longer, and \nexperience significantly more symptoms that they attribute to their illness. \nAlso, they are more concerned about their illness, and their disease more often \ninfluences them emotionally. Differences regarding 'consequences', 'concern' and \n'emotional response' were also clinically relevant. The majority of patients \nstated that the cause of their disease was unknown (23.3%), hereditary (20.3%), \nlifestyle (15.1%), psychological distress (11.9%) or other (11.6%). Significant \ndifferences in perceptions on cause of disease between Type Ds and non-Type Ds \nwere found for psychological distress (16.2 vs. 10.9%; p<0.01), randomness (1.7 \nvs. 5.3%; p<0.01) and unknown (18.8 vs. 24.4%; p<0.01). Multivariate analyses \nshowed that Type D was negatively associated with 'coherence' and positively \nwith 'consequences', 'timeline', 'identity', 'concern', and 'emotional \nrepresentation'.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results elucidate the associations between personality and \nillness perceptions, demonstrating their close interrelatedness. Our study may \nbe helpful in further developing theoretical models regarding giving meaning to \nillness and the illness perceptions that the illness elicits.

In all animals investigated so far, both the protostome genes \nand the vertebrate Lbx1 genes were found to play crucial roles in neural and \nmuscle development. Recently however, additional Lbx genes with divergent \nexpression patterns were discovered in amniotes. Early in the evolution of \nvertebrates, two rounds of whole genome duplication are thought to have \noccurred, during which 4 Lbx genes were generated. Which of these genes were \nmaintained in extant vertebrates, and how these genes and their functions \nevolved, is not known.\nRESULTS: Here we searched vertebrate genomes for Lbx genes and discovered novel \nmembers of this gene family. We also identified signature genes linked to \nparticular Lbx loci and traced the remnants of 4 Lbx paralogons (two of which \nretain Lbx genes) in amniotes. In teleosts, that have undergone an additional \ngenome duplication, 8 Lbx paralogons (three of which retain Lbx genes) were \nfound. Phylogenetic analyses of Lbx and Lbx-associated genes show that in \nextant, bony vertebrates only Lbx1- and Lbx2-type genes are maintained. Of \nthese, some Lbx2 sequences evolved faster and were probably subject to \nneofunctionalisation, while Lbx1 genes may have retained more features of the \nancestral Lbx gene. Genes at Lbx1 and former Lbx4 loci are more closely related, \nas are genes at Lbx2 and former Lbx3 loci. This suggests that during the second \nvertebrate genome duplication, Lbx1/4 and Lbx2/3 paralogons were generated from \nthe duplicated Lbx loci created during the first duplication event.\nCONCLUSION: Our study establishes for the first time the evolutionary history of \nLbx genes in bony vertebrates, including the order of gene duplication events, \ngene loss and phylogenetic relationships. Moreover, we identified genetic \nhallmarks for each of the Lbx paralogons that can be used to trace Lbx genes as \nother vertebrate genomes become available. Significantly, we show that bony \nvertebrates only retained copies of Lbx1 and Lbx2 genes, with some Lbx2 genes \nbeing highly divergent.

Here, we report \nthat maintaining high levels of Mitimere or Nubbin, two POU proteins, in a GMC \ncauses it to undergo self-renewing asymmetric divisions.

Our results provide key insights into mechanisms of pre-RC \nformation and have important implications for understanding the role of the \nMCM2-7 in establishment of bidirectional replication forks."

Rachmilewitz \nscoring system (endoscopic activity index [EAI]) was used to determine UC \nactivity, and as for CD activity, CD activity index (CDAI) scoring was used. IMA \nmeasurement was performed with ELISA kit.\nRESULTS: Ischemia-modified albumin levels in IBD, UC, and CD groups were \ncomparably higher than the control group (37.7 ng/mL vs 42.4 ng/mL vs 36.4 ng/mL \nvs 21.8 ng/mL, respectively; P < 0.05).

Transferrin-bound iron \nbinding to transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is essential for cellular iron delivery \nduring erythropoiesis. We hypothesize that apotransferrin's effect is mediated \nvia decreased TfR1 expression and evaluate TfR1 expression in β-thalassemic mice \nin vivo and in vitro with and without added apotransferrin. Our findings \ndemonstrate that β-thalassemic erythroid precursors overexpress TfR1, an effect \nthat can be reversed by the administration of exogenous apotransferrin.

These findings strongly suggest that \noverexpressed TfR1 may play a regulatory role contributing to iron overload and \nanemia in β-thalassemic mice. To evaluate further, we crossed TfR1+/- mice, \nthemselves exhibiting iron-restricted erythropoiesis with increased hepcidin, \nwith β-thalassemic mice.

Within each treatment arm, Q-TWiST was \ncalculated by adding the mean time spent in each health state weighted by its \nrespective quality-of-life, represented by health utility. The relative Q-TWiST \ngain, calculated as the difference in Q-TWiST between treatment arms divided by \nthe mean survival of the 7 + 3 control arm, was determined in order to evaluate \nresults in the context of other Q-TWiST analyses.\nRESULTS: The relative Q-TWiST gain with CPX-351 versus 7 + 3 was 53.6% in the \nbase case scenario and 39.8% among responding patients.

The results of the total IgE and Phadiatop tests \nas well as the positive items in the ImmunoCAP assay were recorded and analyzed.\nRESULTS: A total of 9174 cases with complete data were enrolled, including 576 \nchildren and 8598 adults. A positive result in the ImmunoCAP assay was \nconsidered a positive atopic status towards aeroallergens. While using the total \nIgE levels to predict positive aeroallergens, the sensitivities and \nspecificities were 65.7% and 85.7%, respectively, for adults and 86.3% and \n77.4%, respectively, for children. When we used Phadiatop tests for allergy \nscreening, the sensitivities and specificities was 94.5% and 98.2%, \nrespectively, for the adult group and 98.5% and 96.8%, respectively, for the \npediatric group.\nCONCLUSION: The Phadiatop test had better diagnostic power for aeroallergen \ndetection than the serum total IgE levels, or even the dual test, for both the \nadult and pediatric groups in this hospital-based study. We suggest that the \nPhadiatop test is more cost-effective in aeroallergen screening for patients \nwith suspected atopic airway diseases."

    "corpus_id": "20356359",
    "corpus": "BACKGROUND: Injury severity measures are based either on the Abbreviated Injury \nScale (AIS) or the International Classification of diseases (ICD). The latter is \nmore convenient because routinely collected by clinicians for administrative \nreasons. To exploit this advantage, a proprietary program that maps ICD-9-CM \ninto AIS codes has been used for many years. Recently, a program called ICDPIC \ntrauma and developed in the USA has become available free of charge for \nregistered STATA users. We compared the ICDPIC calculated Injury Severity Score \n(ISS) with the one from direct, prospective AIS coding by expert trauma \nregistrars (dAIS).\nMETHODS: The administrative records of the 289 major trauma cases admitted to \nthe hospital of Udine-Italy from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 and enrolled in the \nItalian Trauma Registry were retrieved and ICDPIC-ISS was calculated. The \nagreement between ICDPIC-ISS and dAIS-ISS was assessed by Cohen's Kappa and \nBland-Altman charts. We then plotted the differences between the 2 scores \nagainst the ratio between the number of traumatic ICD-9-CM codes and the number \nof dAIS codes for each patient (DIARATIO). We also compared the absolute \ndifferences in ISS among 3 groups identified by DIARATIO. The discriminative \npower for survival of both scores was finally calculated by ROC curves.\nRESULTS: The scores matched in 33/272 patients (12.1%, k 0.07) and, when \ncategorized, in 80/272 (22.4%, k 0.09). The Bland-Altman average difference was \n6.36 (limits: minus 22.0 to plus 34.7). ICDPIC-ISS of 75 was particularly \nunreliable. The differences increased (p < 0.01) as DIARATIO increased \nindicating incomplete administrative coding as a cause of the differences. The \narea under the curve of ICDPIC-ISS was lower (0.63 vs. 0.76, p = 0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite its great potential convenience, ICPIC-ISS agreed poorly \nwith its conventionally calculated counterpart. Its discriminative power for \nsurvival was also significantly lower. Incomplete ICD-9-CM coding was a main \ncause of these findings. Because this quality of coding is standard in Italy and \nprobably in other European countries, its effects on the performances of other \ntrauma scores based on ICD administrative data deserve further research. Mapping \nICD-9-CM code 862.8 to AIS of 6 is an overestimation."

The patient is a Japanese boy with \nacanthosis nigricans, lack of subcutaneous fat, hirsutism, thick lips, gum \nhypertrophy and extremely high insulin levels (6702 mU/mL). He was as having \nidentified novel compound heterozygous mutations in INSR (p.T910M and p. \nE1047K). At 24 day-old, recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1 (rh-IGF1) \ntreatment was started because of poor weight gain. At 2 years old, the patient's \nserum glucose level and HbA1C value had worsened, and both a bolus of rh-IGF-1 \nand a subcutaneous injection of a rapid-acting insulin analog after meals, in \naddition to α-glycosidase inhibitor, were initiated from 2 years onward.

In the experiments conducted using COS7 cells homozygously \ntransfected with the INSR mutation, T910M INSR failed to process the proreceptor \nand decreased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. E1047K INSR resulted \nin a complete absence of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. These \nfindings suggest the near absence of INSR in this patient.

    "question": "Are genes symmetrically distributed between leading and lagging DNA strand in bacteria?",
    "correct_answer": "In most bacteria, genes are preferentially encoded on the leading strand than on the lagging strand. This avoids the potentially detrimental head-on collisions that occur between the replication and transcription machineries when genes are encoded on the lagging strand. Head-on collisions are more deleterious than codirectional collisions, and may lead to replication fork arrest and genomic instability. Genes of some functional categories such as ribosome have higher preferences to be on the leading strands, while genes of other functional categories such as transcription factor have higher preferences on the lagging strands. Strand-biased gene distribution correlates with replication-associated purine asymmetry and the presence or absence of polC. Especially essential and highly transcribed genes and genes whose expression is important for fitness are more preferentially situated at the leading strand in bacteria.",
    "corpus_id": "24273314",
    "corpus": "Genomic DNA is used as the template for both replication and transcription, \nwhose machineries may collide and result in mutagenesis, among other damages. \nBecause head-on collisions are more deleterious than codirectional collisions, \ngenes should be preferentially encoded on the leading strand to avoid head-on \ncollisions, as is observed in most bacterial genomes examined. However, why are \nthere still lagging strand encoded genes? Paul et al. recently proposed that \nthese genes take advantage of the increased mutagenesis resulting from head-on \ncollisions and are thus adaptively encoded on the lagging strand. We show that \nthe evidence they provided is invalid and that the existence of lagging strand \nencoded genes is explainable by a balance between deleterious mutations that \nbring genes from the leading to the lagging strand and purifying selection \npurging such mutants. Therefore, the adaptive hypothesis is neither \ntheoretically needed nor empirically supported."

    "correct_answer": "Several labs have obtained evidence for a protein complex that involves many of the nonstructural (NS) proteins encoded by the virus. NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B appear to interact structurally and functionally. The interaction between the helicase, NS3, and the RNA polymerase, NS5B play a key role in viral replication. Pull-down experiments and surface plasmon resonance data indicate a direct interaction between NS3 and NS5B that is primarily mediated through the protease domain of NS3. This interaction reduces the basal ATPase activity of NS3. However, NS5B stimulates product formation in RNA unwinding experiments under conditions of excess nucleic acid substrate. When the concentrations of NS3 and NS5B are in excess of nucleic acid substrate, NS5B reduces the rate of NS3-catalyzed unwinding. Under pre-steady-state conditions, in which NS3 and substrate concentrations are similar, product formation increased in the presence of NS5B. The increase was consistent with 1:1 complex formed between the two proteins.",

In the setting of isolated benzodiazepine \noverdose, flumazenil is capable of completely reversing coma within one to two \nminutes, with this effect lasting between one and five hours.

This in turn might obviate \nthe need for further expensive (eg, computed tomography) and sometimes invasive \n(eg, lumbar puncture) diagnostic modalities.

The Lausanne NoSAS (Neck circumference, \nObesity, Snoring, Age, Sex) score test is a simple, efficient, and easily \nemployed tool enabling identification of individuals at risk for the disease. \nThe score ranges from 0 to 17 and the patient has a high probability of OSA if \nthey have a NoSAS score of 8 or higher.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the NoSAS score as a screening tool \nfor the diagnosis of OSA in a sleep clinic.\nMETHODS: Prospectively, for 12 months, we included all the patients referred by \nprimary care physicians to our sleep unit for clinical evaluation who had \nundergone in-lab polysomnography (PSG) and completed the NoSAS score. This test \nassigns 4 points for a neck circumference of more than 40cm, 3 points for a \nbody-mass index of 25kg/m2 to less than 30kg/m2 or 5 points for having a \nbody-mass index of 30kg/m2 or more, 2 points for snoring, 4 points for being \nolder than 55 years of age and 2 points for being male.\nRESULTS: Of the 294 patients, 70.7% were male, aged 53.5±12.1 years, with a neck \ncircumference of 41.0±3.6cm and a BMI of 30.8±5.1kg/m2. OSA was present in 84.0% \nof the patients, 34.8% with moderate OSA and 36.4% severe OSA. Using the NoSAS \nmodel for the prediction of all OSA, moderate/severe OSA and severe OSA, the \narea under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) was 0.770 (IC95%: (0.703; \n0.837), p<0.001), 0.746 (IC95%: (0.691; 0.802), p<0.001) and 0.686 (IC95%: \n(0.622; 0.749), p<0.001), respectively, thus confirming the diagnostic ability \nof the NoSAS model. With a NoSAS score ≥7, the sensitivity and positive \npredictive value (PPV) were 94.3% and 87.6% for all OSA, 94.9% and 62.8% for \nmoderate/severe OSA and 100% and 33.8% for severe OSA, respectively. With the \nsame cut-off, the negative predictive value (NPV) for moderate/severe and severe \nOSA were 67.9% and 100%, respectively. Each increase in the NoSAS score was \nassociated with an increase in the probability of OSA, reaching a 97% OSA \nprobability for a score of 17.\nCONCLUSIONS: The NoSAS score showed high sensitivity and PPV for OSA with \nspecificity and diagnostic accuracy steadily increasing with higher scores. \nFurthermore, a low score showed high predictive value for the exclusion of \nmoderate/severe OSA. Overall, our results suggest that, in primary care, this \nscore can be a powerful tool for stratifying and prioritizing patients in the \ndiagnosis of OSA. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy \nof this score in hospital health care, in younger populations, with a \npredominance of female and non-obese individuals or in cardiovascular disease."

It has been reported that transforming growth factor-β \n(TGF-β) can activate myofibroblasts. Moreover, the fibroblast to myofibroblast \ntransformation (FMT) can be triggered by TGF-β, which is a major mediator of \nsubepithelial fibrosis. Secreted modular calcium-binding protein 2 (SMOC2) is a \nmember of cysteine (SPARC) family and is involved in the progression of multiple \ndiseases. However, its role in asthma remains poorly understood. RT-qPCR \nevaluated the expression of SMOC2. Bromodeoxyuridine assay and wound-healing \nassay detected the proliferation and migration of lung fibroblasts, \nrespectively. IF staining was performed to assess the expression of α-smooth \nmuscle actin (α-SMA). Western blot analysis detected the levels of proteins. \nFlow cytometry was utilized for determination of the number of myofibroblasts.\nRESULTS: We found the expression of SMOC2 was upregulated by the treatment of \nTGF-β1 in lung fibroblasts. In addition, SMOC2 promoted the proliferation and \nmigration of lung fibroblasts. More importantly, SMOC2 accelerated FMT of lung \nfibroblasts. Furthermore, SMOC2 was verified to control the activation of AKT \nand ERK. Rescue assays showed that the inhibition of AKT and ERK pathway \nreversed the promoting effect of SMOC2 overexpression on proliferation, \nmigration and FMT in lung fibroblasts.\nCONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrated that SMOC2 modulated TGF-β1-induced \nproliferation, migration and FMT in lung fibroblasts and may promote asthma, \nwhich potentially provided a novel therapeutic target for the management of \nasthma."

Therefore, there is a clear need for a sequence similarity search tool \nthat can rapidly detect weak similarity in large datasets.\nRESULTS: We developed a tool, which we named CLAST (CUDA implemented large-scale \nalignment search tool), that enables analyses of millions of reads and thousands \nof reference genome sequences, and runs on NVIDIA Fermi architecture graphics \nprocessing units. CLAST has four main advantages over existing alignment tools. \nFirst, CLAST was capable of identifying sequence similarities ~80.8 times faster \nthan BLAST and 9.6 times faster than BLAT. Second, CLAST executes global \nalignment as the default (local alignment is also an option), enabling CLAST to \nassign reads to taxonomic and functional groups based on evolutionarily distant \nnucleotide sequences with high accuracy. Third, CLAST does not need a \npreprocessed sequence database like Burrows-Wheeler Transform-based tools, and \nthis enables CLAST to incorporate large, frequently updated sequence databases. \nFourth, CLAST requires <2 GB of main memory, making it possible to run CLAST on \na standard desktop computer or server node.\nCONCLUSIONS: CLAST achieved very high speed (similar to the Burrows-Wheeler \nTransform-based Bowtie 2 for long reads) and sensitivity (equal to BLAST, BLAT, \nand FR-HIT) without the need for extensive database preprocessing or a \nspecialized computing platform.

The majority of human TFRs correlate with orthologous TFRs in the mouse, despite the fact that most transposons are lineage specific. Many human TFRs also overlap with orthologous TFRs in the marsupial opossum, indicating that these regions have remained refractory to transposon insertion for long evolutionary periods. Over 90% of the bases covered by TFRs are noncoding, much of which is not highly conserved.

Within other genomic regions, Minos transposes essentially \nat random, whereas P or piggyBac elements display distinctive hotspots and \ncoldspots. P elements, as previously shown, have a strong preference for \npromoters. In contrast, piggyBac site selectivity suggests that it has evolved \nto reduce deleterious and increase adaptive changes in host gene expression.

To address this need, we developed lipidr, an open-source \nR/Bioconductor package for data mining and analysis of lipidomics datasets. \nlipidr implements a comprehensive lipidomic-focused analysis workflow for \ntargeted and untargeted lipidomics. lipidr imports numerical matrices, Skyline \nexports, and Metabolomics Workbench files directly into R, automatically \ninferring lipid class and chain information from lipid names. Through \nintegration with the Metabolomics Workbench API, users can search, download, and \nreanalyze public lipidomics datasets seamlessly. lipidr allows thorough data \ninspection, normalization, and uni- and multivariate analyses, displaying \nresults as interactive visualizations. To enable interpretation of lipid class, \nchain length, and total unsaturation data, we also developed and implemented a \nnovel lipid set enrichment analysis. A companion online guide with two live \nexample datasets is presented at https://www.lipidr.org/.

In part 2, men received placebo or 20, 60, or 180 mg each day for \n10 days. In part 3, women received placebo or 20, 60, or 180 mg each day for 21 \ndays, where dosing was initiated on day 3 ± 2 after menses.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and \npharmacodynamics on circulating levels of LH, FSH, testosterone, estradiol, and \nprogesterone, in addition to physiological biomarkers of endometrial thickening, \nfollicle growth, and the duration of the menstrual cycle were evaluated.\nRESULTS: ESN364 was well-tolerated and rapidly bioavailable with linear \npharmacokinetics and no drug accumulation with repeated, daily oral \nadministration. Drug treatment dose-dependently decreased basal LH, but not FSH, \nand consequently decreased estradiol and progesterone (in women) as well as \ntestosterone (in men). The hormonal changes in women corresponded to delayed \novulation, decreased endometrial thickening, impeded follicular maturation, and \nprolongation of the menstrual cycle. Drug effects were rapidly reversible.\nCONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of the NK3R antagonist, ESN364, suppressed the \nhypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in healthy volunteers by selective \nmodulation of gonadotropin secretion, leading to a restrained decrease in \novarian hormone levels in women. These results suggest that ESN364 may offer \ntherapeutic benefit in the treatment of women's health disorders with a \nmitigated risk of menopausal-like adverse events."

Additional interventions in the factorial design of the study will \ncompare the effect of (1) aspirin versus placebo on CV events (and cancer), (2) \nvitamin D versus placebo on the risk of fractures, and (3) the combined effect \nof aspirin and the Polycap on CV events.\nRESULTS: The study has randomized 5713 participants across 9 countries.

Recent studies have shown the importance of chromatin structure in the \nregulation of latent infection for both HSV and HIV.

In this study, we \nfurther defined the structure of latent viral chromatin by examining the \nheterochromatin markers on histones associated with the HSV latent genome. We \ndetected the H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3 modifications, with H3K27me3, which \nis indicative of facultative heterochromatin, exhibiting the highest enrichment \non all viral promoters tested.

The electrophysiological properties of the channels harboring the \nidentified mutation were examined. Western blotting and immunostaining were \nemployed to characterize the expression and intracellular localization of the \nmutant channel molecules.\nRESULTS: A novel heterozygous mutation (c.910-2delTTC or TTT, Phe304del) of \nKCNQ2 was identified in the patient. The mutation was de novo verified by \nparentage analysis. The mutation was associated with impaired functions of KCNQ \nK(+) channel. The mutant channels were expressed on the cell surface.\nCONCLUSION: The mutant Phe304del of KCNQ2 leads to null function of the KCNQ \nK(+) channel but the mutation does not alter proper channel sorting onto the \ncell membrane. Our findings indicate that the genes responsible for rare \ninherited forms of idiopathic epilepsy could be also involved in sporadic forms \nof idiopathic epilepsy and expand our notion of the involvement of molecular \nmechanisms in the more common forms of idiopathic epilepsy."

    "corpus": "BACKGROUND: It is estimated that 1-13% of cases of bronchiectasis in adults \nglobally are attributable to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) but many adult \npatients with bronchiectasis have not been investigated for PCD. PCD is a \ndisorder caused by mutations in genes required for motile cilium structure or \nfunction, resulting in impaired mucociliary clearance. Symptoms appear in \ninfancy but diagnosis is often late or missed, often due to the lack of a \"gold \nstandard\" diagnostic tool and non-specific symptoms. Mutations in > 50 genes \naccount for around 70% of cases, with additional genes, and non-coding, \nsynonymous, missense changes or structural variants (SVs) in known genes \npresumed to account for the missing heritability.\nMETHODS: UK patients with no identified genetic confirmation for the cause of \ntheir PCD or bronchiectasis were eligible for whole genome sequencing (WGS) in \nthe Genomics England Ltd 100,000 Genomes Project. 21 PCD probands and 52 \nnon-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis probands were recruited in Wessex Genome \nMedicine Centre (GMC). We carried out analysis of single nucleotide variants \n(SNVs) and SVs in all families recruited in Wessex GMC.\nRESULTS: 16/21 probands in the PCD cohort received confirmed (n = 9), probable \n(n = 4) or possible (n = 3) diagnosis from WGS, although 13/16 of these could \nhave been picked up by current standard of care gene panel testing. In the other \ncases, SVs were identified which were missed by panel testing. We identified \nvariants in novel PCD candidate genes (IFT140 and PLK4) in 2 probands in the PCD \ncohort. 3/52 probands in the non-CF bronchiectasis cohort received a confirmed \n(n = 2) or possible (n = 1) diagnosis of PCD. We identified variants in novel \nPCD candidate genes (CFAP53 and CEP164) in 2 further probands in the non-CF \nbronchiectasis cohort.\nCONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing is an important component of diagnosing PCD, \nespecially in cases of atypical disease history.

    "corpus_id": "29106564",
    "corpus": "In the past few years, proton therapy has taken the centre stage in treating \nvarious tumour types. The primary contribution of this study is to investigate \nthe tumour control probability (TCP), relapse time and the corresponding \nsecondary cancer risks induced by proton beam radiation therapy. We incorporate \ntumour relapse kinetics into the TCP framework and calculate the associated \nsecond cancer risks. To calculate proton therapy-induced secondary cancer \ninduction, we used the well-known biologically motivated mathematical model, \ninitiation-inactivation-proliferation formalism. We used the available in vitro \ndata for the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of cell killing and \nmutation induction parameters. We evaluated the TCP and radiation-induced second \ncancer risks for protons in the clinical range of LETs, i.e. approximately 8 \n$\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the tumour volume and 1-3 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the \norgans at risk. This study may serve as a framework for further work in this \nfield and elucidates proton-induced TCP and the associated secondary cancer \nrisks, not previously reported in the literature. Although studies with a \ngreater number of cell lines would reduce uncertainties within the model \nparameters, we argue that the theoretical framework presented within is a \nsufficient rationale to assess proton radiation TCP, relapse and carcinogenic \neffects in various treatment plans. We show that compared with photon therapy, \nproton therapy markedly reduces the risk of secondary malignancies and for \nequivalent dosing regimens achieves better tumour control as well as a reduced \nprimary recurrence outcome, especially within a hypo-fractionated regimen."

The present study \nexplored the use of NRT for 2 weeks before a target quit-smoking date, during \nwhich subjects continued to smoke ad libitum. Three experimental conditions \nvaried the nicotine delivery of the cigarettes smoked during these 2 weeks so \nthat we could examine the effects of concurrent nicotine administration on \ncompensatory smoking of low tar and nicotine cigarettes. Subjects smoked (a) \ntheir usual brands of cigarettes, (b) conventional low tar and nicotine \ncigarettes, or (c) denicotinized cigarettes. After the quit date, subjects \nreceived pharmacotherapy consisting of various doses of NRT (0, 21, or 42 \nmg/24-hr) in combination with the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (10 mg/day). \nResults showed that precessation nicotine patch treatment was associated with a \nsignificantly higher rate of continuous smoking abstinence at 4 weeks, \nregardless of cigarette condition. Ad libitum smoking before the target quit \ndate was modulated by nicotine patch treatment, and compensatory increases in \nsmoking low tar and nicotine cigarettes were prevented by concurrent use of \nnicotine patches. These results suggest that use of NRT before a target \nquit-smoking date deserves further evaluation as a possible smoking cessation \ntreatment.

In the \npresent study, the issue of whether atemoya shows food-drug interactions with \nsubstrate drugs of the major drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450s (i.e., CYP1A2, \nCYP2C9, and CYP3A) is addressed.\nMETHODS: The ability of atemoya juice to inhibit the activities of phenacetin \nO-deethylase (CYP1A2), diclofenac 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C9), and midazolam \n1'-hydroxylase (CYP3A) was examined in vitro using human and rat liver \nmicrosomes.

In spite of this \ninhibition, preadministration of atemoya had no effect on the pharmacokinetics \nof phenacetin, a CYP1A2 substrate, in rats. Meanwhile, preadministration of \nfluvoxamine significantly extended the time needed for the elimination of \nphenacetin, possibly due to the inhibition of CYP1A2.

These studies show that one of these \ntranscripts, NEAT1 localizes to the periphery of such domains, whereas the \nneighboring transcript, NEAT2, is part of the long-sought polyadenylated \ncomponent of nuclear speckles.\nCONCLUSION: Our genome-wide screens in two mammalian species reveal no more than \nthree abundant large non-coding polyadenylated RNAs in the nucleus; the \ncanonical large noncoding RNA XIST and NEAT1 and NEAT2. The function of these \nnoncoding RNAs in mRNA metabolism is suggested by their high levels of \nconservation and their intimate association with SC35 splicing domains in \nmultiple mammalian species."

    "corpus": "OBJECTIVE: To identify the effect of a controlled metabolic diet on reducing \nurinary calcium oxalate (CaOx) supersaturation in subjects with hyperoxaluric \nnephrolithiasis after potentially malabsorptive forms of bariatric surgery.\nMETHODS: Subjects with a history of CaOx kidney stones and mild hyperoxaluria \nafter bariatric surgery (n = 9) collected baseline 24-hour urine samples while \nconsuming a free choice diet. They were then instructed to consume a controlled \ndiet low in oxalate (70-80 mg/d), normal in calcium (1000 mg/d), and moderate in \nprotein before 2 final 24-hour urine collections.\nRESULTS: Overall, the urinary CaOx supersaturation decreased from 1.97 ± 0.49 \ndelta Gibbs (DG) with the free choice diet to 1.13 ± 0.75 DG with the controlled \ndiet (P < .01). This occurred in the absence of a significant change in urinary \noxalate excretion (0.69 ± 0.29 mmol/d with the free choice diet compared with \n0.66 ± 0.38 mmol/d with the controlled diet). Urinary volume, citrate, and pH \nall increased, although not significantly (P > .05), contributing to the \nsignificant CaOx supersaturation change.\nCONCLUSION: A controlled metabolic diet normal in calcium, moderate in protein, \nand reduced in oxalate can positively affect urinary CaOx supersaturation after \nbariatric surgery. However, this diet did not appear to decrease urinary oxalate \nexcretion. Therefore, restriction of dietary oxalate alone might not be enough \nto reduce urinary oxalate excretion to normal levels in this group of patients \nwith known enteric hyperoxaluria. Additional strategies could be necessary, such \nas the use of oral calcium supplements as oxalate binders and a lower fat diet."

ZIKV amplifications are frequent in southeastern \nSenegal but little is known about their seasonal and spatial dynamics. The aim \nof this paper is to describe the spatio-temporal patterns of the 2011 ZIKV \namplification in southeastern Senegal.\nMETHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: Mosquitoes were collected monthly from April to December \n2011 except during July. Each evening from 18:00 to 21:00 hrs landing \ncollections were performed by teams of 3 persons working simultaneously in \nforest (canopy and ground), savannah, agriculture, village (indoor and outdoor) \nand barren land cover sites.

In addition, \ncomparative genome analysis showed that the chaperonin-dependent substrates were \nless conserved, suggesting that these substrates were acquired later on in \nevolutionary history.\nCONCLUSIONS: This result implies the expansion of metabolic networks due to this \nchaperonin, and it supports the existing hypothesis of acceleration of evolution \nby chaperonins. The distribution of chaperonin substrate enzymes in the \nmetabolic network is inexplicable because it does not seem to be associated with \nindividual protein features such as protein abundance, which has been observed \ncharacteristically in chaperonin substrates in previous works. However, it \nbecomes clear by considering this expansion process due to chaperonin. This \nfinding provides new insights into metabolic evolution and the roles of \nchaperonins in living systems."

    "corpus": "BACKGROUND: In search of potential early biomarkers for timely prediction of \ngestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), we focused on afamin, a vitamin E-binding \nprotein in human plasma.. Afamin plays a role in anti-apoptotic cellular \nprocesses related to oxidative stress and is associated with insulin resistance \nand other features of metabolic syndrome. During uncomplicated pregnancy its \nserum concentrations increase linearly. The aim of this study was to investigate \nthe suitability of afamin as early marker for predicting GDM.\nMETHODS: In a first-trimester cohort from a prospective observational study of \nadverse pregnancy outcomes we secondarily analyzed afamin concentrations in 59 \npatients diagnosed with GDM and 51 controls. Additionally, afamin concentrations \nwere cross-sectionally examined in a mid-trimester cohort of 105 women and \ncompared with results from a simultaneously performed oral glucose tolerance \ntest (OGTT). Subgroup analysis comparing patients treated with either insulin \n(iGDM) or dietary intervention (dGDM) was performed in both cohorts. Patients \nwere recruited at the University Hospital Essen, Germany, between 2003 and 2016.\nRESULTS: Results were adjusted for body-mass-index (BMI) and gestational age. \nFirst and mid-trimester cohorts yielded significantly elevated afamin \nconcentrations in patients with pathological OGTT compared to patients without \nGDM (first trimester cohort: mean, 113.4 mg/l; 95% CI, 106.4-120.5 mg/l and \n87.2 mg/l; 95% CI, 79.7-94.7 mg/l; mid-trimester cohort: mean, 182.9 mg/l; 95% \nCI, 169.6-196.2 mg/l and 157.3 mg/l; 95% CI, 149.1-165.4 mg/l, respectively). In \nthe first-trimester cohort, patients developing iGDM later in pregnancy \npresented with significantly higher afamin concentrations compared to patients \ndeveloping dGDM and compared to patients without GDM. In the mid-trimester \ncohort, mean concentrations of afamin differed significantly between patients \nwith dGDM compared to controls and between patients with iGDM and controls. \nPatients with iGDM showed only slightly higher afamin levels compared to \npatients with dGDM.\nCONCLUSION: Afamin may serve as a new early biomarker for pathological glucose \nmetabolism during pregnancy. Further research is needed to determine afamin's \nconcentrations during pregnancy, its predictive value for early detection of \npregnancies at high risk to develop GDM and its diagnostic role during the \nsecond trimester."

The rate \nat which a gene is transcribed may depend upon the presence or absence of a \ncollection of transcription factors bound to the DNA near the gene. Locating \ntranscription factor binding sites in genomic DNA is difficult because the \nindividual sites are small and tend to occur frequently by chance. True binding \nsites may be identified by their tendency to occur in clusters, sometimes known \nas regulatory modules.\nRESULTS: We describe an algorithm for detecting occurrences of regulatory \nmodules in genomic DNA. The algorithm, called mcast, takes as input a DNA \ndatabase and a collection of binding site motifs that are known to operate in \nconcert. mcast uses a motif-based hidden Markov model with several novel \nfeatures. The model incorporates motif-specific p-values, thereby allowing \nscores from motifs of different widths and specificities to be compared \ndirectly. The p-value scoring also allows mcast to only accept motif occurrences \nwith significance below a user-specified threshold, while still assigning better \nscores to motif occurrences with lower p-values. mcast can search long DNA \nsequences, modeling length distributions between motifs within a regulatory \nmodule, but ignoring length distributions between modules. The algorithm \nproduces a list of predicted regulatory modules, ranked by E-value.

In order to compensate for the lack of bone height, several \ntreatment options have been proposed. These treatment alternatives aimed at the \ninstallation of dental implants with or without the utilization of bone grafting \nmaterials avoiding the perforation of the Schneiderian membrane. Nevertheless, \nmembrane perforations represent the most common complication among these \nprocedures. Consequently, the present review aimed at the elucidation of the \nrelevance of this phenomenon on implant survival and complications.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual literature searches were performed \nby two independent reviewers in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, \nand Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles up to January 2018 \nreporting outcome of implant placement perforating the sinus floor without \nregenerative procedure (lateral sinus lift or transalveolar technique) and graft \nmaterial. The intrusion of the implants can occur during drilling or implant \nplacement, with and without punch out Schneiderian. Only studies with at least \n6 months of follow-up were included in the qualitative assessment.\nRESULTS: Eight studies provided information on the survival rate, with a global \nsample of 493 implants, being the weighted mean survival rate 95.6% (IC 95%), \nafter 52.7 months of follow-up. The level of implant penetration (≤ 4 mm or \n> 4 mm) did not report statistically significant differences in survival rate \n(p = 0.403). Seven studies provided information on the rate of clinical \ncomplications, being the mean complication rate 3.4% (IC 95%). The most frequent \nclinical complication was epistaxis, without finding significant differences \naccording to the level of penetration. Five studies provide information on the \nradiographic complication; the most common complication was thickening of the \nSchneiderian membrane. The weighted complication rate was 14.8% (IC 95%), and \npenetration level affects the rate of radiological complications, being these of \n5.29% in implant penetrating ≤4 mm and 29.3% in implant penetrating > 4 mm, \nwithout reaching statistical significant difference (p = 0.301).\nCONCLUSION: The overall survival rate of the implants into the sinus cavity was \n95.6%, without statistical differences according to the level of penetration. \nThe clinical and radiological complications were 3.4% and 14.8% respectively. \nThe most frequent clinical complication was the epistaxis, and the radiological \ncomplication was thickening of the Schneiderian membrane, without reaching \nstatistical significant difference according to the level of implant penetration \ninside the sinus."

SNX1 depletion by small \ninterfering RNA resulted in decreased pools of sortilin in the TGN and an \nincrease in lysosomal degradation. These data indicate that sortilin and MPRs \nrecycle to the TGN in SNX1-dependent carriers, which we named endosome-to-TGN \ntransport carriers (ETCs). Notably, ETCs emerge from early endosomes (EE), lack \nrecycling plasma membrane proteins and by three-dimensional electron tomography \nexhibit unique structural features. Hence, ETCs are distinct from hitherto \ndescribed EE-derived membranes involved in recycling. Our data emphasize an \nimportant role of EEs in recycling to the TGN and indicate that different, \nspecialized exit events occur on the same EE vacuole."

    "corpus": "BACKGROUND: Childhood brain tumor diagnoses are stressful for families. Children \ndiagnosed with craniopharyngioma (Cp) present with particularly challenging \nmedical and cognitive problems due to tumor location and associated \nbiophysiologic comorbidities. This study examined parental distress in a sample \nof families of patients with Cp treated with proton beam therapy to identify \nfactors for targeting psychological intervention.\nPROCEDURE: Prior to (n = 96) and 1 year after (n = 73) proton therapy, parents \nof children diagnosed with Cp (9.81 ± 4.42 years at baseline; 49% male) \ncompleted a self-report measure of distress, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). \nChildren completed cognitive assessment measures at baseline; medical variables \nwere extracted from the study database.\nRESULTS: At baseline, t-tests revealed parents reported higher levels of \ndistress than normative expectations on Anxiety, Depression, Global Severity, \nand Positive Symptom Distress BSI scales (P < 0.05). Linear mixed effects models \nrevealed parent report measures of child executive dysfunction and behavioral \nissues were more predictive of parental distress than patients' cognitive \nperformance or medical status (P < 0.05). Models also revealed a significant \nreduction only in Anxiety over time (t = -2.19, P < 0.05). Extensive \nhypothalamic involvement at baseline predicted this reduction (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Parents experience significant distress before their child begins \nadjuvant therapy for Cp, though parental distress appears largely unrelated to \nmedical complications and more related to parent perceptions of child cognitive \ndifficulties (vs. child performance). Importantly, this may be explained by a \nnegative parent reporting style among distressed parents. Knowledge of \nsocio-emotional functioning in parents related to patient characteristics is \nimportant for optimization of psychological intervention."

    "correct_answer": "SR calcium uptake is mediated by a Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2), whose activity is reversibly regulated by phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA and phosphorylation of PLN relieves this inhibition. Phospholamban (PLN) is a small integral membrane protein, which binds and inhibits in a yet unknown fashion the Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Based on structural and dynamics data, a model in which PLN undergoes allosteric activation upon encountering SERCA has been proposed. The allosteric regulation of SERCA depends on the conformational equilibrium of PLN, whose cytoplasmic regulatory domain interconverts between three different states: a ground T state (helical and membrane associated), an excited R state (unfolded and membrane detached), and a B state (extended and enzyme-bound), which is noninhibitory. Phosphorylation of PLN shifts the populations toward the B state, increasing SERCA activity. Phospholamban (PLN) regulates cardiac contractility via its modulation of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) activity. Impairment of this regulatory process causes heart failure.",

At present, de novo cardiomyocytes can be generated either in vitro, using directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells, or in vivo via direct reprogramming of resident adult cardiac fibroblast or ectopic stimulation of resident cardiac stem or progenitor cells. The production of human cardiac progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells provides an amenable source of cells for applications in drug discovery, disease modeling, regenerative medicine, and cardiotoxicity screening. In addition, the ability to derive human-induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic tissues, combined with current high-throughput screening and pharmacogenomics, may help realize the use of these cells to fulfill the potential of personalized medicine. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) provide a unique opportunity to study \"disease in a dish\" within a defined genetic and environmental background. Patient-derived iPSCs have been successfully used to model cardiomyopathies, rhythm disorders and vascular disorders. Long-QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia are two heart rhythm disorders that have been already successfully modeled by several groups using this approach, which will likely serve to model other mono- or polygenetic cardiovascular disorders in the future. The use of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to study genetic cardiovascular disorders will enable a deeper and more applicable understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human disease, as well as improving our ability to achieve successful cell-based therapies.",

The present study investigated possible \ninteractions between alpha1 adrenergic and thyroid hormone signaling at the \nlevel of TRalpha1, potential underlying mechanisms and physiological \nconsequences, as well as the role of TRalpha1 in cell differentiation. This may \nbe of physiological relevance since both thyroid hormone and adrenergic \nsignalling are implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiac remodelling. \nNeonatal cardiomyocytes obtained from newborn rats (2-3 days) were exposed to \nphenylephrine (PE, an alpha1 adrenergic agonist) for 5 days, in the absence or \nexcess of T3 in the culture medium. PE, in the absence of T3, resulted in 5.0 \nfold increase in TRalpha1 expression in nucleus and 2.0 fold decrease in \nTRalpha1 expression in cytosol, P<0.05. As a result, a fetal pattern of myosin \nisoform expression with marked expression of beta-MHC was observed in PE treated \nvs the untreated cells, P<0.05. PD98059 (an ERK signalling inhibitor) abrogated \nthis response. In the presence of T3 in the culture medium, TRalpha1 expression \nwas increased 1.6 fold in nucleus and 2.0 fold in cytosol in PE-T3 vs PE treated \ncells, P<0.05, and the fetal pattern of myosin isoform expression was prevented. \nParallel studies with H9c2 myoblasts showed that reduction of T3 binding to \nTRalpha1 receptor delayed cardiac myoblasts differentiation without affecting \nproliferation. In conclusion, in neonatal cardiomyocytes, nuclear TRalpha1 is \noverexpressed after prolonged activation of the alpha1- adrenergic signalling by \nPE.

A Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms of disease \nor Toxicity (Q-TWiST) analysis of the phase 3 study was performed to compare \nsurvival quality between patients receiving CPX-351 versus conventional 7 + 3 \nafter 5 years of follow-up.\nMETHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 between December 20, 2012 and November 11, \n2014 to receive induction with CPX-351 or 7 + 3. Survival time for each patient \nwas partitioned into 3 health states: TOX (time with any grade 3 or 4 toxicity \nor prior to remission), TWiST (time in remission without relapse or grade 3 or 4 \ntoxicity), and REL (time after relapse). Within each treatment arm, Q-TWiST was \ncalculated by adding the mean time spent in each health state weighted by its \nrespective quality-of-life, represented by health utility. The relative Q-TWiST \ngain, calculated as the difference in Q-TWiST between treatment arms divided by \nthe mean survival of the 7 + 3 control arm, was determined in order to evaluate \nresults in the context of other Q-TWiST analyses.\nRESULTS: The relative Q-TWiST gain with CPX-351 versus 7 + 3 was 53.6% in the \nbase case scenario and 39.8% among responding patients. Across various \nsensitivity analyses, the relative Q-TWiST gains for CPX-351 ranged from 48.0 to \n57.6%, remaining well above the standard clinically important difference \nthreshold of 15% for oncology.\nCONCLUSIONS: This post hoc analysis demonstrates that CPX-351 improved \nquality-adjusted survival, further supporting the clinical benefit in patients \nwith newly diagnosed high-risk/secondary acute myeloid leukemia.

    "corpus": "OBJECTIVE: To identify disease-related genes and immune-regulatory pathways in \nthe pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) by using gene expression \nprofiling and protein-protein interaction analysis.\nMETHODS: Peripheral white blood cell gene expression profiles of 10 SLE patients \nwere determined by oligonucleotide microarray analysis. Clustering of the gene \nexpression profile was compared with the clinical immune phenotype. SLE-induced \ngenes that were over- or under-expressed were determined and independently \nvalidated using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. To study \ntheir potential function and the possible pathways involved, a candidate gene \nwas cloned and a GST (glutathione S-transferase) fusion protein was expressed in \nEscherichia coli. The fusion protein was further purified using the glutathione \nSepharose 4B system, and was treated as bait to capture prey from SLE peripheral \nwhite blood cell lysate. MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser \ndesorption/ionization-time-of-flight) mass spectrometry was then performed to \ndetermine the prey protein.\nRESULTS: Similarity was found between the gene expression profile and the immune \nphenotype clusters of the SLE patients. More than 20 disease-associated genes \nwere identified, some of which have not been related to SLE previously. Of these \ngenes, a cluster of interferon-induced genes were highly correlated. IFIT1 \n(interferon-induced with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) was one of these genes, \nand overexpression of its mRNA was confirmed independently by real-time PCR in a \nlarger population (40 SLE patients and 29 normal controls). An IFIT1 protein- \nprotein interaction study showed that IFIT1 may interact with Rho/Rac guanine \nnucleotide exchange factor.\nCONCLUSION: The gene expression profile seems to be the molecular basis of the \ndiverse immune phenotype of SLE. On the basis of the SLE-related genes found in \nthis study, we suggest that the interferon-related immune pathway is important \nin the pathogenesis of SLE. IFIT1 is the first gene described as a candidate \ngene for SLE, and may function by activating Rho proteins through interaction \nwith Rho/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor. IFIT1 and the \ninterferon-related pathway may provide potential targets for novel interventions \nin the treatment of SLE."

Here, we report \na simple, non-isotopic assay for determining DNA damaging agents that induce \nNER-repairable DNA lesions by visualizing gene expression from treated \nfluorescent protein vectors in a mammalian cell system. This assay is based on a \ncomparison of fluorescent protein expression in NER-proficient and NER-deficient \ncells.

It is generally a successful operation, but has well-documented risks \nfor the patient. Thulium laser transurethral vaporesection of the prostate \n(ThuVARP) vaporises and resects the prostate using a surgical technique similar \nto TURP. The small amount of study data currently available suggests that \nThuVARP may have certain advantages over TURP, including reduced blood loss and \nshorter hospital stay, earlier return to normal activities, and shorter duration \nof catheterisation.\nDESIGN: A multicentre, pragmatic, randomised, controlled, parallel-group trial \nof ThuVARP versus standard TURP in men with BPO. Four hundred and ten men \nsuitable for prostate surgery were randomised to receive either ThuVARP or TURP \nat four university teaching hospitals, and three district general hospitals. The \nkey aim of the trial is to determine whether ThuVARP is equivalent to TURP \njudged on both the patient-reported International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) \nand the maximum urine flow rate (Qmax) at 12 months post-surgery.\nDISCUSSION: The general population has an increased life expectancy. As men get \nolder their prostates enlarge, potentially causing BPO, which often requires \nsurgery. Therefore, as the population ages, more prostate operations are needed \nto relieve obstruction. There is hence sustained interest in the condition and \nincreasing need to find safer techniques than TURP. Various laser techniques \nhave become available but none are widely used in the NHS because of lengthy \ntraining required for surgeons or inferior performance on clinical outcomes. \nPromising initial evidence from one RCT shows that ThuVARP has equivalent \nclinical effectiveness when compared to TURP, as well as other potential \nadvantages. As ThuVARP uses a technique similar to that used in TURP, the \nlearning curve is short, potentially making it also very quickly generalisable. \nThis randomised study is designed to provide the high-quality evidence, in an \nNHS setting, with a range of patient-reported, clinical and cost-effectiveness \noutcomes, which will underpin and inform future NICE guidance.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN00788389 .

The total number of epileptiform discharges during each session \n(before, during, and after music) were divided by the duration (in minutes) of \nthe session and then compared.

Some 4 weeks, \ndiabetic animals were injected with insulin (3 U/day) for 4 weeks. Both \nsarcolemmal (SL) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes were isolated from \nthe ventricular tissue and their Ca(2+)-transporting activities were determined. \nSL Na(+)-dependent Ca2+ uptake, ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake and Ca(2+)-stimulated \nATPase activities were depressed in the diabetic heart.

Intriguing examples such as GPR35 for inflammatory \nbowel disease and CXCR4 for viral infection are used as illustrations of how a \nsystematic approach can aid in the prioritization of interesting drug discovery \nhypotheses. Combining evidences for G-protein coupled receptors and their \ncorresponding endogenous peptidergic ligands increases confidence and provides \nsupportive evidence for potential new target-disease hypotheses. Comparing such \nhypotheses to the global pharma drug discovery pipeline to validate the approach \nshowed that more than 93% of G-protein coupled receptor-disease pairs with a \nhigh overall Open Targets score involved receptors with an existing drug \ndiscovery program.\nCONCLUSIONS: The Open Targets gene-disease score can be used to prioritize \npotential G-protein coupled receptors-indication hypotheses. In addition, \navailability of multiple different evidence types markedly increases confidence \nas does combining evidence from known receptor-ligand pairs. Comparing the \ntop-ranked hypotheses to the current global pharma pipeline serves validation of \nour approach and identifies and prioritizes new therapeutic opportunities."

While Nox1-4 \nrequire regulatory subunits, including p22phox, Nox5 activity does not depend on \nany subunits. We found that inactive point mutants and truncated forms of Nox5 \n(including the naturally expressed splice form, Nox5S) inhibit full-length Nox5, \nconsistent with formation of a dominant negative complex. Oligomerization of \nfull-length Nox5 was demonstrated using co-immunoprecipitation of coexpressed, \ndifferentially tagged forms of Nox5 and occurred in a manner independent of \ncalcium ion. Several approaches were used to show that the DH domain mediates \noligomerization: Nox5 could be isolated as a multimer when the calcium-binding \ndomain and/or the N-terminal polybasic region (PBR-N) was deleted, but deletion \nof the DH domain eliminated oligomerization. Further, a chimera containing the \ntransmembrane domain of Ciona intestinalis voltage sensor-containing phosphatase \n(CiVSP) fused to the Nox5 DH domain formed a co-immunoprecipitating complex \nwith, and functioned as a dominant inhibitor of, full-length Nox5. Radiation \ninactivation of Nox5 overexpressed in HEK293 cells and endogenously expressed in \nhuman aortic smooth muscle cells indicated molecular masses of ∼350 and ∼300 \nkDa, respectively, consistent with a tetramer being the functionally active \nunit. Thus, Nox5 forms a catalytically active oligomer in the membrane that is \nmediated by its dehydrogenase domain.

FzE3 was over-expressed in 9 cases (75%) of gastric carcinoma \ntissues while hsFRP was down-regulated in 2 cases (16%). Beta-catenin nuclear \nstaining was identified in 3 cases (27%) and cyclin D1 was expressed in 5 cases \n(41%) of cancer samples. All these cases were associated with either \nup-regulation of FzE3 or down-regulation of hsFRP. Our results suggested that \nalterations of FzE3 or hsFRP were frequent in gastric cancer. These provide \nalternative mechanisms leading to activation of Wnt signaling pathway in gastric \ncarcinogenesis."

Individual induction of HOXD8, HOXD9, HOXD10 or HOXD12 is sufficient to \ninduce both growth arrest and neuronal differentiation, which is associated with \ndownregulation of cell cycle-promoting genes and upregulation of neuronal \ndifferentiation genes.

DNMT1 is specific for hemi-methylated DNA and ensures the faithful transmission of DNA methylation patterns in every replication cycle. DNMT3 is required for de novo methylation of DNA. DNMT3 targets unmethylated DNA and is responsible for the establishment of new methylation patterns.

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer.\nRetroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

Delayed \nanti-LOXL2 treatment of active TAA fibrosis significantly reduced collagen \ncrosslinking and histological signs of bridging fibrosis, with a 53% reduction \nin morphometric collagen deposition.

In this study, we aim to investigate the \ndirect effect of musclin on vascular tone and to analyze its role in \nhypertension using the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In aortic strips \nisolated from SHR, musclin induced contractions in a dose-dependent manner. We \nfound that the musclin-induced vasoconstriction was more marked in SHR than in \nnormal rats (WKY). Moreover, this contraction was reduced by blockade of \nnatriuretic peptide receptor C using the ab14355 antibody. Therefore, mediation \nof the natriuretic peptide receptor in musclin-induced vasoconstriction can be \nconsidered. In addition, similar to the natriuretic peptide receptor, expression \nof the musclin gene in blood vessels was higher in SHR than in WKY.

Tissue levels of these mRNAs were generally decreased in \nhypothyroid animals and were up-regulated again after thyroid hormone (T3) \ntreatment. However, significant increases in the levels of all nuclear \ntranscripts were observed in the liver 24 h after T3 treatment, but were delayed \nor remained unaltered (VIc) in muscle. In contrast, levels of mitochondrial \ntranscripts were elevated early in muscle and late in liver. The abundance of \nthe corresponding polypeptides, which were analyzed by immunoblotting, changed \nin direction and magnitude according to the changes in their mRNAs, indicating \npretranslational control. We conclude that the two genomes are regulated by T3 \nnot through a common coordinating mechanism, but via two separate pathways, \nwhich respond to T3 with tissue-specific kinetics. S1-nuclease protection \nanalysis showed that probably only one transcript for subunit VIc is present in \nboth tissues, thus excluding the possibility that the tissue-specific response \nis due to the expression of two isogenes. The abundance of mitochondrial DNA was \nunaltered despite the observed changes in mitochondrial transcripts, indicating \nthat mitochondrial gene expression is regulated by transcriptional mechanisms \nand not by gene dosage as has been postulated by others."

Here, we performed a \nlarge-scale mutagenesis-based analysis of the APOBEC3G N terminus, testing \nmutants for (i) inhibition of vif-defective HIV-1 infection and Alu \nretrotransposition, (ii) RNA binding, and (iii) oligomerization. Furthermore, in \nthe absence of structural information on this domain, we used homology modeling \nto examine the positions of functionally important residues and of residues \nfound to be under positive selection by phylogenetic analyses of primate \nAPOBEC3G genes. Our results reveal the importance of a predicted RNA binding \ndimerization interface both for packaging into HIV-1 virions and inhibition of \nboth HIV-1 infection and Alu transposition. We further found that the \nHIV-1-blocking activity of APOBEC3G N-terminal mutants defective for packaging \ncan be almost entirely rescued if their virion incorporation is forced by fusion \nwith Vpr, indicating that the corresponding region of APOBEC3G plays little role \nin other aspects of its action against this pathogen.

The down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation that \nis observed in aging and dementia is attributed to deficiency of thioretinaco \nozonide oxygen complexed with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and phosphate, \nwhich catalyzes oxidative phosphorylation. Adenosyl methionine biosynthesis is \ndependent upon thioretinaco ozonide and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the \ndeficiency of adenosyl methionine and impaired immune function in aging are \nattributed to depletion of thioretinaco ozonide from mitochondrial membranes. \nAllyl sulfides and furanonaphthoquinones protect against oxidative stress and \napoptosis by increasing the endogenous production of hydrogen sulfide and by \ninhibiting electron transfer to the active site of oxidative phosphorylation. \nDiallyl trisulfide and napabucasin inhibit the signaling by the signal \ntransducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), potentially enhancing \nimmune function by effects on T helper lymphocytes and promotion of apoptosis. \nHomocysteine promotes endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis by the unfolded \nprotein response and endoplasmic reticulum stress through activation of the \nN-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, causing oxidative stress, calcium influx, \napoptosis and endothelial dysfunction.

The \nobserved discordance between state-of-the-art VC pipelines, however, indicates \nthat the current practice still suffers from non-negligible numbers of false \npositive and negative SNV and INDEL calls that were shown to be enriched among \ndiscordant calls but also in genomic regions with low sequence complexity.\nRESULTS: Here, we describe our method ReliableGenome (RG) for partitioning \ngenomes into high and low concordance regions with respect to a set of surveyed \nVC pipelines. Our method combines call sets derived by multiple pipelines from \narbitrary numbers of datasets and interpolates expected concordance for genomic \nregions without data. By applying RG to 219 deep human WGS datasets, we \ndemonstrate that VC concordance depends predominantly on genomic context rather \nthan the actual sequencing data which manifests in high recurrence of regions \nthat can/cannot be reliably genotyped by a single method. This enables the \napplication of pre-computed regions to other data created with comparable \nsequencing technology and software. RG outperforms comparable efforts in \npredicting VC concordance and false positive calls in low-concordance regions \nwhich underlines its usefulness for variant filtering, annotation and \nprioritization. RG allows focusing resource-intensive algorithms (e.g. consensus \ncalling methods) on the smaller, discordant share of the genome (20-30%) which \nmight result in increased overall accuracy at reasonable costs. Our method and \nanalysis of discordant calls may further be useful for development, benchmarking \nand optimization of VC algorithms and for the relative comparison of call sets \nbetween different studies/pipelines.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: RG was implemented in Java, source code and \nbinaries are freely available for non-commercial use at \nhttps://github.com/popitsch/wtchg-rg/ CONTACT: niko@wtchg.ox.ac.ukSupplementary \ninformation: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels \nwere shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH \nmedulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases. \nHere, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are \nconsistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high \nexpression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425 \nmedulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2, \nEED, SUZ12 and RBBP4 and upregulation of H3K27 demethylases KDM6A, KDM6B, JARID2 \nand KDM7A. This was accompanied by decreased H3K27me3 and increased H3K27me1 \nlevels in promoter regions. Strikingly, the decrease of H3K27me3 was most \nprominent in promoters that bind OTX2. OTX2-bound promoters showed high levels \nof the H3K4me3 and H3K9ac activation marks and intermediate levels of the \nH3K27me3 inactivation mark, reminiscent of a bivalent modification. After \nsilencing of OTX2, H3K27me3 levels strongly dropped, but H3K4me3 and H3K9ac \nlevels remained high. OTX2-bound bivalent genes showed high expression levels in \nD425, but the expression of most of these genes did not change after OTX2 \nsilencing and loss of the H3K27me3 mark.

Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at CTCF regions that is not present at promoters. DNA methylation determines nucleosome occupancy in the 5'-CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. In contrast, exons demonstrate a high degree of methylation and nucleosome occupancy. Although global DNA demethylation has been observed after treatment, it is unclear to what extent demethylation induces changes in nucleosome occupancy, a key determinant of gene expression. In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps  of multiple cellular origins. Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome occupancy upon the DNA methylation status. Exonic DNA methylation seems to function together with exonic nucleosomes and H3K36me3 for the proper splicing of transcripts with different expression levels. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this \"ground state\" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy. ",

The first group has higher \nnucleosome occupancy on exons than introns, whereas the second group exhibits \nweak nucleosome marking of exons, suggesting another type of epigenetic marker \ndistinguishes exons from introns when GC content is similar. We find different \nand specific patterns of DNA methylation in each of the GC architectures; yet in \nboth groups, DNA methylation clearly marks the exons. Exons of the leveled GC \narchitecture exhibit a significantly stronger DNA methylation signal in relation \nto their flanking introns compared to exons of the differential GC architecture. \nThis is accentuated by a reduction of the DNA methylation level in the intronic \nsequences in proximity to the splice sites and shows that different epigenetic \nmodifications mark the location of exons already at the DNA level. Also, lower \nlevels of methylated CpGs on alternative exons can successfully distinguish \nalternative exons from constitutive ones.

Our observations show that, under \ncontrol conditions, the stimulated release of [3H]noradrenaline is mainly \nassociated with the opening of N-type channels, while in the presence of \n3,4-diaminopyridine the contribution of L-type channels becomes more important. \nThe alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation by UK 14304 inhibits the release of \n[3H]noradrenaline but, in the presence of 3,4-diaminopyridine, the inhibition of \nrelease can only be observed if the massive influx through L-type calcium \nchannels is prevented.

In animal models, edaravone has been shown to reduce neuronal damage by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), maintain intact the autoregulation of the cerebral vasculature, decrease neuronal loss, reduce programmed cell death, the presence of inflammatory cytokines, cerebral edema, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Edaravone also protects against neurological deficits and memory deficits following traumatic brain injury.",

    "corpus": "Traumatic axonal injury (TAI), a feature of traumatic brain injury (TBI), \nprogressively evolves over hours through impaired axonal transport and is \nthought to be a major contributor to cognitive dysfunction. In spite of various \nstudies suggesting that pharmacologic or physiologic interventions might reduce \nTAI, clinical neuroprotective treatments are still unavailable. Edaravone, a \nfree radical scavenger, has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in \nanimal models of several brain disorders. In this study, to evaluate whether \nedaravone suppresses TAI following TBI, mice were subjected to weight drop \ninjury and had either edaravone (3.0mg/kg) or saline administered intravenously \nimmediately after impact. Axonal injury and oxidative stress were assessed using \nimmunohistochemistry with antibodies against amyloid precursor protein, a marker \nof impaired axonal transport, and with 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, a marker of \noxidative DNA damage. Edaravone significantly suppressed axonal injury and \noxidative stress in the cortex, corpus callosum, and hippocampus 24h after \ninjury. The neuroprotective effects of edaravone were observed in mice receiving \n1.0, 3.0, or 10mg/kg of edaravone immediately after impact, but not after \n0.3mg/kg of edaravone. With treatment 1h after impact, axonal injury was also \nsignificantly suppressed and this therapeutic effect persisted up to 6h after \nimpact. Furthermore, behavioral tests performed 9 days after injury showed \nmemory deficits in saline-treated traumatized mice, which were not evident in \nthe edaravone-treated group. These results suggest that edaravone protects \nagainst memory deficits following TBI and that this protection is mediated by \nsuppression of TAI and oxidative stress."

Mct8 transports thyroid hormones (T4 and \nT3), and the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome is likely caused by lack of T3 \ntransport to neurons during critical periods of fetal brain development. To \nevaluate the role of Mct8 in thyroid hormone action in the fetal brain we \nadministered T4 or T3 to thyroidectomized pregnant dams treated with \nmethyl-mercapto-imidazol to produce maternal and fetal hypothyroidism. Gene \nexpression was then measured in the fetal cerebral cortex. T4 increased Camk4, \nSema3c, and Slc7a3 expression, but T3 was without effect. To investigate the \ncause for the lack of T3 action we analyzed the expression of organic anion \ntransport polypeptide (Oatp14, Slco1c1), a T4 transporter, and Mct8 (Slc16a2), a \nT4 and T3 transporter, by confocal microscopy. Both proteins were present in the \nbrain capillaries forming the blood-brain barrier and in the epithelial cells of \nthe choroid plexus forming the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. It is \nconcluded that T4 from the maternal compartment influences gene expression in \nthe fetal cerebral cortex, possibly after transport via organic anion \ntransporter polypeptide and/or Mct8, and conversion to T3 in the astrocytes. On \nthe other hand, T3 does not reach the target neurons despite the presence of \nMct8. The data indicate that T4, through local deiodination, provides most T3 in \nthe fetal rat brain.

Nickel is present in most of \nthe constituents of a normal diet, but some food groups are usually considered \nto be richer. However, the nickel content of specific food can vary widely, \ndepending on many factors. Thus, the daily intake of nickel is also highly \nvariable both among different populations and in a single individual, in \ndifferent seasons and even in different days. Measuring precisely the daily \nintake of nickel from food and drinks is extremely difficult, if not impossible. \nThe relationship between ACD and contact with nickel is undisputed and widely \nconfirmed in literature. The situation is different for systemic nickel allergy \nsyndrome (SNAS). The SNAS can have cutaneous signs and symptoms (Systemic \nContact Dermatitis or SCD) or extracutaneous signs and symptoms \n(gastrointestinal, respiratory, neurological, etc.).The occurrence of SCD as a \nsystemic reaction to the nickel normally assumed in the daily diet is very \ncontroversial.

Optimal surgical treatment is still a challenge.\nMETHODS: We report three cases, all women, ages 22, 30, and 39 years, \nrespectively, who had known VHL, confirmed by classic organ manifestations and \ngermline mutations of the VHL gene. All were diagnosed, in an asymptomatic \nstage, with solid tumors of the pancreatic tail or tail/corpus area measuring \n2.9-5.6 cm diameter. All accepted the offer of laparoscopic organ-sparing \nremoval of the tumors.\nRESULTS: In all three cases, the tumor was entirely removed.

This study further investigated the roles of \nROS with respect to mitotic arrest and the apoptotic effect of sulforaphane, and \nthe maximum level of ROS accumulation was observed 3h after sulforaphane \ntreatment. However, a ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, notably attenuated \nsulforaphane-mediated apoptosis as well as mitotic arrest.

This recoding event occurs either by direct suppression of termination via the insertion of an amino acid at the stop codon (readthrough) or by alteration of the mRNA reading frame (frameshift).",

    "corpus": "BACKGROUND: In the C. albicans retrotransposon Tca2, the gag and pol ORFs are \nseparated by a UGA stop codon, 3' of which is a potential RNA pseudoknot. It is \nunclear how the Tca2 gag UGA codon is bypassed to allow pol expression. However, \nin other retroelements, translational readthrough of the gag stop codon can be \ndirected by its flanking sequence, including a 3' pseudoknot.\nRESULTS: The hypothesis was tested that in Tca2, gag stop codon flanking \nsequences direct translational readthrough and synthesis of a gag-pol fusion \nprotein. Sequence from the Tca2 gag-UGA-pol junction (300 nt) was inserted \nbetween fused lacZ and luciferase (luc) genes in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae dual \nreporter construct. Although downstream of UGA, luc was expressed, but its \nexpression was unaffected by inserting additional stop codons at the 3' end of \nlacZ. Luc expression was instead being driven by a previously unknown minor \npromoter activity within the gag-pol junction region. Evidence together \nindicated that junction sequence alone cannot direct UGA readthrough. Using \nreporter genes in C. albicans, the activities of this gag-pol junction promoter \nand the Tca2 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter were compared. Of the two \npromoters, only the LTR promoter was induced by heat-shock, which also triggers \nretrotransposition. Tca2 pol protein, epitope-tagged in C. albicans to allow \ndetection, was also heat-shock induced, indicating that pol proteins were \nexpressed from a gag-UGA-pol RNA.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first demonstration that the LTR promoter directs Tca2 \npol protein expression, and that pol proteins are translated from a gag-pol RNA, \nwhich thus requires a mechanism for stop codon bypass. However, in contrast to \nmost other retroelement and viral readthrough signals, immediate gag \nUGA-flanking sequences were insufficient to direct stop readthrough in S. \ncerevisiae, indicating non-canonical mechanisms direct gag UGA bypass in Tca2."

Associated articles of well-preserved clothing, tools, weapons \nand other devices were also present and have been studied in detail. Clinical \nexamination and imaging investigations have also shown that the Icemen had \nexperienced possible illnesses in his lifetime and had identifiable areas of \narthritis and musculoskeletal injury. This report includes some key observations \non the musculoskeletal state of Ötzi and reference to the involvement of tattoo \nmarkings. Some aspects about the aetiology of his abnormalities and inflammatory \narthritis are considered along with possible treatments that he might have \nemployed.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We (WFK and MK) undertook a clinical musculoskeletal \nexamination of the Iceman, details of which with available photographs and \nradiographic imaging pertaining to the musculoskeletal findings of the Iceman \nare reported here. The skin of the Iceman has numerous linear carbon tattoos, \nwhich are not of a decorative type. These have been presumed to possibly be \n\"medicinal\" tattoos administered for therapeutic reasons and may have been used \nin acupuncture-like treatment of pain. Spinal imaging identified areas of spinal \ndamage and our observations have provided clues as to possible sites of spinal \ninitiated pain and hence sites for administration of the \"medicinal\" tattoos. We \nobserved body areas of the Iceman, in which imaging demonstrated arthritis and \nother forms of long-term musculoskeletal damage, but which do not have adjacent \nor corresponding \"medicinal\" tattoos. We contend that the back and leg \n\"medicinal\" tattoos correspond directly to sites of chronic right knee and right \nankle pain, and left thoracolumbar pain. They also correspond to lower lumbar \nand sciatic referred radicular pain which may have a contributory cause related \nto the presence of a transitional lumbar 5 vertebra. Using recent published data \n(Keller et al. in Nature Commun 3:698, 2012. doi: 10.1038/ncomms1701 ) of the \ngenome structure of the Iceman, we suggest some potential causes of the \nosteoarthritis or inflammatory joint injury may relate to presence of coronary \nheart disease (CHD) and Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi) infection.

In addition, we observed other nucleosome protection sites in DHBV \nminichromosomes that may vary among individual ducks, but the pattern of MNase \nmapping in those regions is transmittable from the adult ducks to the newly \ninfected ducklings. These results imply that the nucleosomes along viral cccDNA \nin the minichromosomes are not random but sequence-specifically positioned. \nFurthermore, we showed in ducklings that a significant portion of cccDNA \npossesses a few negative superhelical turns, suggesting the presence of \nintermediates of viral minichromosomes assembled in the liver, where dynamic \nhepatocyte growth and cccDNA formation occur.

In this paper, we present Logic Alignment Free (LAF), a method that \ncombines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in \norder to assign biological samples to their taxa. This method searches for a \nminimal subset of k-mers whose relative frequencies are used to build \nclassification models as disjunctive-normal-form logic formulas (if-then rules). \nWe apply LAF successfully to the classification of bacterial genomes to their \ncorresponding taxonomy. In particular, we succeed in obtaining reliable \nclassification at different taxonomic levels by extracting a handful of rules, \neach one based on the frequency of just few k-mers. State of the art methods to \nadjust the frequency of k-mers to the character distribution of the underlying \ngenomes have negligible impact on classification performance, suggesting that \nthe signal of each class is strong and that LAF is effective in identifying it."

This long-lived intermediate state was introduced in 1988 (Grosberg et al. 1988) and has not been observed in experiments or simulations until recently (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). Recent characterization of human chromatin using a novel chromosome conformational capture technique brought the fractal globule into the spotlight as a structural model of human chromosome on the scale of up to 10 Mb (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). The fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model and emphasizes topological constraints as a primary factor driving formation of chromosomal territories.",

In general, heterochromatin has been linked to trimethylation of H3 at lysine 9 and parsimony analysis reveal that histone H3K9 methylation is, next to histone deacetylation, the evolutionary most stable heterochromatic mark. Classical histone modifications associated with heterochromatin also include H3K27me1 and H3K27me2. H3K36me3 function is not restricted to actively transcribed regions only and may contribute to the composition of heterochromatin. Other histone methylation marks usually found in constitutive heterochromatin are H4K20me3, H3K9me3, and H3K79me3. H3S10P is a good marker of pericentromeric heterochromatin.",

As such, it is an \ninstructive source to understand the molecular basis for changes in chromatin \nstructure that correlate with transcriptional status. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and \nsuppressor of variegation 3-9 homologue 1 (SUV39H1) are amongst the enzymes \nresponsible for chromatin modulations associated with facultative \nheterochromatin formation. SUV39H1 is the principal enzyme responsible for the \naccumulation of histone H3 containing a tri-methyl group at its lysine 9 \nposition (H3K9me3) in regions of heterochromatin. SIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent \ndeacetylase that targets histone H4 at lysine 16 (refs 3 and 4), and through an \nunknown mechanism facilitates increased levels of H3K9me3 (ref. 3). Here we show \nthat the mammalian histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 is itself targeted by the \nhistone deacetylase SIRT1 and that SUV39H1 activity is regulated by acetylation \nat lysine residue 266 in its catalytic SET domain. SIRT1 interacts directly \nwith, recruits and deacetylates SUV39H1, and these activities independently \ncontribute to elevated levels of SUV39H1 activity resulting in increased levels \nof the H3K9me3 modification. Loss of SIRT1 greatly affects SUV39H1-dependent \nH3K9me3 and impairs localization of heterochromatin protein 1.

In all animals investigated so far, both the protostome genes \nand the vertebrate Lbx1 genes were found to play crucial roles in neural and \nmuscle development. Recently however, additional Lbx genes with divergent \nexpression patterns were discovered in amniotes. Early in the evolution of \nvertebrates, two rounds of whole genome duplication are thought to have \noccurred, during which 4 Lbx genes were generated. Which of these genes were \nmaintained in extant vertebrates, and how these genes and their functions \nevolved, is not known.\nRESULTS: Here we searched vertebrate genomes for Lbx genes and discovered novel \nmembers of this gene family. We also identified signature genes linked to \nparticular Lbx loci and traced the remnants of 4 Lbx paralogons (two of which \nretain Lbx genes) in amniotes. In teleosts, that have undergone an additional \ngenome duplication, 8 Lbx paralogons (three of which retain Lbx genes) were \nfound. Phylogenetic analyses of Lbx and Lbx-associated genes show that in \nextant, bony vertebrates only Lbx1- and Lbx2-type genes are maintained. Of \nthese, some Lbx2 sequences evolved faster and were probably subject to \nneofunctionalisation, while Lbx1 genes may have retained more features of the \nancestral Lbx gene. Genes at Lbx1 and former Lbx4 loci are more closely related, \nas are genes at Lbx2 and former Lbx3 loci.

Methylation-free CpG clusters, so-called HTF islands, are most often associated with the promoter regions of housekeeping genes, whereas genes expressed in a single-cell type are usually deficient in these sequences. All housekeeping and widely expressed genes have a CpG island covering the transcription start, whereas 40% of the genes with a tissue-specific or limited expression are associated with islands. It has been envisaged that CpG islands are often observed near the transcriptional start sites (TSS) of housekeeping genes.

Here, we \nshow that GC skew can distinguish four classes of promoters, including three \ntypes of CGI promoters, each associated with unique epigenetic and gene ontology \nsignatures. In particular, we identify a strong and a weak class of CGI \npromoters and show that these loci are enriched in distinct chromosomal \nterritories reflecting the intrinsic strength of their protection against DNA \nmethylation. Interestingly, we show that strong CGI promoters are depleted from \nthe X chromosome while weak CGIs are enriched, a property consistent with the \nacquisition of DNA methylation during dosage compensation. Furthermore, we \nidentify a third class of CGI promoters based on its unique GC skew profile and \nshow that this gene set is enriched for Polycomb group targets. Lastly, we show \nthat nearly 2000 genes harbor GC skew at their 3' ends and that these genes are \npreferentially located in gene-dense regions and tend to be closely arranged. \nGenomic profiling of R-loops accordingly showed that a large proportion of genes \nwith terminal GC skew form R-loops at their 3' ends, consistent with a role for \nthese structures in permitting efficient transcription termination. Altogether, \nwe show that GC skew and R-loop formation offer significant insights into the \nepigenetic regulation, genomic organization, and function of human genes."

Melanoma is highly influenced in its aggressive phenotype by the \nchanges it determinates in its microenvironment, such as pH decrease, in turn \ninfluencing cancer cell invasiveness, progression and tissue remodelling through \nan abundant secretion of exosomes, dictating cancer strategy to the whole host. \nA role of exosomes in driving melanoma progression under microenvironmental \nacidity was never described.\nMETHODS: We studied four differently staged human melanoma lines, reflecting \nmelanoma progression, under microenvironmental acidic pHs pressure ranging \nbetween pH 6.0-6.7. To estimate exosome secretion as a function of tumor stage \nand environmental pH, we applied a technique to generate native fluorescent \nexosomes characterized by vesicles integrity, size, density, markers expression, \nand quantifiable by direct FACS analysis. Functional roles of exosomes were \ntested in migration and invasion tests. Then we performed a comparative \nproteomic analysis of acid versus control exosomes to elucidate a specific \nsignature involved in melanoma progression.\nRESULTS: We found that metastatic melanoma secretes a higher exosome amount than \nprimary melanoma, and that acidic pH increases exosome secretion when melanoma \nis in an intermediate stage, i.e. metastatic non-invasive. We were thus able to \nshow that acidic pH influences the intercellular cross-talk mediated by \nexosomes. In fact when exposed to exosomes produced in an acidic medium, pH \nnaïve melanoma cells acquire migratory and invasive capacities likely due to \ntransfer of metastatic exosomal proteins, favoring cell motility and \nangiogenesis. A Prognoscan-based meta-analysis study of proteins enriched in \nacidic exosomes, identified 11 genes (HRAS, GANAB, CFL2, HSP90B1, HSP90AB1, GSN, \nHSPA1L, NRAS, HSPA5, TIMP3, HYOU1), significantly correlating with poor \nprognosis, whose high expression was in part confirmed in bioptic samples of \nlymph node metastases.\nCONCLUSIONS: A crucial step of melanoma progression does occur at melanoma \nintermediate -stage, when extracellular acidic pH induces an abundant release \nand intra-tumoral uptake of exosomes. Such exosomes are endowed with \npro-invasive molecules of clinical relevance, which may provide a signature of \nmelanoma advancement."

    "question": "Is scuba diving safe during pregnancy?",
    "correct_answer": "No, scuba diving should be avoided throughout pregnancy because the fetus is at an increased risk for decompression sickness during this activity.",
    "corpus_id": "10087779",
    "corpus": "As interest in scuba diving is increasing in both sexes, doctors need to be \naware of the risks encountered when diving and about gender-related differences \nin these risks. Individuals prone to panic attacks, claustrophobia or reckless \nrisk-taking should avoid diving. In tolerating cold, muscle mass is more \nimportant than the amount of subcutaneous fat. The risk of decompression disease \nseems to be slightly greater among women, probably due to their fat \ndistribution. Pregnant women are recommended not to dive, because the risk of \nbirth defects seems to be greater among those who do, and there is a serious \nrisk of fetal decompression disease. All participants in the sport must be \nresponsible for their own diving safety."

    "correct_answer": "The tradename of apixaban is Eliquis.",
    "corpus_id": "23677804",
    "corpus": "The direct factor Xa inhibitor apixaban (Eliquis(®)) has predictable \npharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and does not require routine \nanticoagulation monitoring. This article reviews the efficacy and tolerability \nof oral apixaban to reduce the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in patients \nwith nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). In the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for \nReduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) \ntrial in patients with AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke, \napixaban recipients were significantly less likely than warfarin recipients to \nexperience stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding or death; the beneficial \neffects of treatment with apixaban versus warfarin were generally maintained \nacross various patient subgroups. Apixaban recipients also had a significantly \nlower risk of intracranial haemorrhage than warfarin recipients. In the AVERROES \n(Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation \nPatients who have Failed or are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Therapy) \ntrial in patients with AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke for \nwhom vitamin K antagonist therapy was unsuitable, apixaban was associated with a \nsignificantly lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism than aspirin, without an \nincrease in the risk of major bleeding. In conclusion, although longer-term \nefficacy and safety data are needed, apixaban is an important new option for use \nin patients with nonvalvular AF to reduce the risk of stroke or systemic \nembolism."

    "corpus_id": "27802242",
    "corpus": "BACKGROUND: Pain, a frequent non-motor symptom in Parkinson's Disease (PD), \nsignificantly impacts on quality of life. Safinamide is a new drug with \ndopaminergic and non-dopaminergic properties, approved in Europe as adjunct \ntherapy to levodopa for the treatment of fluctuating PD patients. Results from \ntwo 24-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies demonstrated that \nsafinamide has positive effects on both motor functions and quality of life in \nPD patients.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of safinamide on pain management in PD \npatients with motor fluctuations using pooled data from studies 016 and SETTLE.\nMETHODS: This post-hoc analysis evaluated the reduction of concomitant pain \ntreatments and the changes in the scores of the items related to pain of the \nParkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39). A path analysis was \nperformed in order to examine direct and indirect associations between \nsafinamide and PDQ-39 pain-related items assessed after 6-months of treatment.\nRESULTS: The percentage of patients with no pain treatments at the end of the \ntrials was significantly lower in the safinamide group compared to the placebo \ngroup. Safinamide 100 mg/day significantly reduced on average the individual use \nof pain treatments by ≈24% and significantly improved two out of three PDQ-39 \npain-related items of the \"Bodily discomfort\" domain.Path analysis showed that \nthe direct effect of safinamide on pain accounted for about 80% of the total \neffect.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that safinamide may have a positive effect on \npain, one of the most underestimated non-motor symptoms. Prospective studies are \nwarranted to investigate this potential benefit."

    "corpus": "BACKGROUND: High myopia with alopecia areata in the occipital region has been \nobserved in patients with Knobloch syndrome caused by COL18A1 mutations. This \nstudy investigated other possible genetic causes of high myopia in patients with \nalopecia areata in the cranial midline.\nMETHODS: Six patients with early onset high myopia and alopecia areata in the \ncranial midline were recruited. Targeted high-throughput sequencing was \nperformed on the proband's DNA to detect potential pathogenic variants. \nCosegregation analysis was performed for available family members. Minigene \nassay and RNA Sequencing were used to validate the abnormality of possible \nsplicing change and gross deletion. Ophthalmological and neuroimaging \nexaminations were performed.\nRESULTS: Eight novel and one known loss-of-function mutants were detected in all \nsix patients, including a gross deletion detected by RNA sequencing. Four \nCOL18A1 mutants in three patients with scalp leisure in the occipital region; \nand five LAMA1 mutations in three patients with scalp leisure in the parietal \nregion. Further assessments indicated that patients with COL18A1 mutations had \nKnobloch syndrome, and the patients with LAMA1 mutations had Poretti-Boltshauser \nsyndrome.\nCONCLUSION: Our study found that early onset high myopia with midline alopecia \nareata could be caused not only by mutations of the COL18A1 gene but also by \nmutations in the LAMA1 gene. To our knowledge, we are the first to observe scalp \ndefects in patients with LAMA1 mutations. High myopia with alopecia areata in \nthe cranial midline could be treated as an early diagnostic clue for \nophthalmologists to consider the two kinds of rare diseases."

    "corpus_id": "22101760",
    "corpus": "Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized antihuman interleukin-6 receptor \nmonoclonal antibody, which inhibits binding of IL-6 to its soluble (sIL-6R) and \nmembrane-expressed (mIL-6R) receptors. The work investigated whether the \nobserved decline in peripheral neutrophil and platelet counts after tocilizumab \nadministration can be directly explained by tocilizumab IL-6R blockade, thus \ndemonstrating the mechanism of tocilizumab action. Tocilizumab and total sIL-6R \nconcentrations, neutrophil and platelet counts from 4 phase 3 studies in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients were available. Patients received 4 or 8 mg/kg \ntocilizumab intravenous infusions every 4 weeks for a total of 6 doses. A \npopulation approach was applied to describe the relationship between tocilizumab \nand sIL-6R concentrations and subsequent changes in neutrophil and platelet \ncounts. Following tocilizumab administration, concentrations of total sIL-6R \nincreased, while neutrophil and platelet counts declined. These changes were \ntransient, with counts returning to their respective baseline levels soon after \ntocilizumab is eliminated from the body. Tocilizumab concentrations were \ndescribed by a two compartment model with parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten \nelimination. The quasi-steady-state target-mediated drug disposition model \ndescribed tocilizumab relationships to total sIL-6R, which allowed computation \nof unobserved unbound sIL-6R concentrations. The neutrophil counts were \ndescribed as a direct function of unbound sIL-6R concentrations. The platelet \ncounts were described by the transit-compartment life-span model with inhibition \nof production that depended on the unbound sIL-6R concentrations. Thus, the \nobserved changes in sIL-6R, neutrophil, and platelet data are consistent with \nthe tocilizumab mechanism of action and can be fully explained by tocilizumab \nbinding to sIL-6R and mIL-6R."
